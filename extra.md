### kind nightmare 

On occasion, it felt like the world was coming for him. Like, he he was the butt of a joke, but he didn't know the joke so he couldn't even try to laugh it off.
"Shounen," Yagi's voice rasped out, "Shounen, you smell so good, you-"
At least, he wished that there was a magical item that would let Yagi think this was someone he wanted. Then, at the very least, he didn't have to feel crushed over something that wasn't his fault. 
And, Midoriya was certain of this, he probably had someone he actually wanted to hold. Instead, this man, the Greatest Hero Japan's ever had, held him.
Midoriya could only pray that, at the end of all of this, he would be able to wipe the slate clean. That he could save the people that he ruined, and that they would be able to find happiness in a future unmarred and untained by his hand.
His eyes watered. All Might would have had a better life if they had never met.
"I'm sorry, shounen," Yagi kissed his eyelids, "I-I'm so, so sorry."
"No," Midoriya shook his head. He scurbbed at his eyes and wrapped his arms around the taller man's neck. This was the least he could do. He wouldn't refuse the person that he stole from. 
His heart ached. If he had known that the only way to be happy was by sacrificing the people around him, then he wouldn't have ever tried. 
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry-"

-

"Izuku, did you know?" Yagi asked, "All the times we've laid together, you've apologized."
Midoriya flinched, his gut reaction when someone brought up their private-affairs, before he dropped his head. Why's he flinching? He's not even the victim here. He bowed his head forward and searched his mind. What did he do wrong this time? Where didn't he go wrong? He-
A hand came to his face, and he repressed the urge to lean against the hand. 
"Does it feel bad?"
"I-I'm sorry."
This time, his hands grabbed his face and forced him to look up. Midoriya stared, wide-eyed and suprised, before he closed his eyes and accepted what would come. 
"Look at me, Izuku."
Slowly, green eyes opened, and the kind smile of Yagi Toshinori greeted his eyes. 
"While I regret how this began, I don't regret that it happened," he explained. His thumbs ran under his eyes, catching tears before they could fall. "I am so happy for this opportunity. 
He leaned in, kissing his forehead before he backed away. With a bright beaming smile, he spoke with all the joy and confidence in the world. If someone could just sound like sunlight, it would be Yagi Toshinori in the hours after dinner, standing in his kitchen, professing a love that could shake the Symbol of Peace.

"So the more sex we have, the higher the level?"
Midoriya tensed, and his eyes looked at him warily, but he nodded his head. 
"Ehhh... " Hawks drew the sound out in his mouth as he tilted his head, "But we had sex last night, right?"
His face flushed at the memory, and nodded slowly. The last time he had a talk like this, he had sex for eight hours straight and Dabi was complaining about how raw the skin on his dick felt. 
"Is it like, every cumshot is a level?"
"I... I'm not sure."
The blond stared at him, and then raised his hand, "In games and stuff, the more you level up, the harder it gets. It makes sense, if you think of it in terms of expertise and the likes." On his palm, the number [28] glowed back. "But your number jumps up every new person right? When we met, it was [56]. For a while, it didn't move, even though I was climbing up like crazy. After Natsuo-kun joined us, your number jumped before it plateau'd again."
"...Then you don't mean that..."
"Sleeping with someone new is a surefire way to raise your level. But the novelity of it tapers off, for you and the new guy."
Midoriya took a step back, and Hawks took a step forward. 
"Comparing how Aizawa-sensei leveled up to me, and the last few weeks," he looked at his hand again and then back at Midoriya, "I'm almost certain about it now."
"W-Wh...What?"
"Midoriya, you're not leveling up because of the sex."
"Then... Then what?"
The blond shook his head, and pulled his gaze, "Haven't figured out that much yet," he said, "but sex is definately a big component of it.
"What... have you tried?"
Hawks stared at Midoriya for a long moment, "Let's grab some lunch," he said. "All this thinking's making me hungry. Some fresh air will help me figure out everything in my head." 
"R-Right," Midoriya nodded, "I'll go grab a jacket then."
"Actually, there's something I want to try," the blond said, a smile on his face as Midoriya's expression turned to worry.

-

Hawks had to hand it to Midoriya. He thought that he would have refused and that would have been the end of that. But instead, Midoriya had pursed his lips, really made Hawks think that he would put down this, frankly awful, idea, but instead, he nodded. 
Hawks wondered if Midoriya was that desperate to level up. The thought made an ugly feeling rise up inside of him. 
But was he upset? Of course not. Midoriya, with a bright red butt plug was next to him, walked on unsteady legs next to him. His face was red and flushed, and he squeezed his thighs together. 
"Wanna hold onto me, Izu?" Hawks asked, to be polite. 
Midoriya's bottom lip trembled, and Hawks couldn't pull his eyes away.
"I-I'm-" He toyed with the remote in his pocket, and Midoriya covered his mouth to try and suppress the quiet whimper that spilled out. He curled in on himself, and his legs were shaking like a baby fawn learning how to walk. 
Hawks felt his heart flutter. He smiled, wanting nothing more than to play some more, when his eyes caught to the awful expression on Midoriya's face. 
The young man, taking heaving breaths, focused on a spot on the ground. He didn't once look up at Hawks, either to blame him or ask him for help. A sheen of sweat crossed his brow, and in a word, he looked miserable. 
The joy and horny energy dissipated in an instant.
"We're going back," Hawks announced. He grabbed Midoriya, and without waiting for anything, he took off.
While in flight, he noticed that Midoriya sat stiffly in his arms. He didn't fight, either because he was too tired, or because he thought Hawks would drop him. The thought that Midoriya trusted him to just sit tight never crossed his mind. He stood at Midoriya's apartment door.
"Y-You can put me down-"
Hawks opened the door by slipping a feather under the doorframe and unlocking it. Entering quickly, he slipped his shoes off and placed Midoriya to sit down on the couch.
The young man let out this moan, something that sent an electric current right to his groin. He sucked in a deep breath and covered his face.
"Midoriya," Hawks said, "You..." He stopped and then took a deep breth. He knew where the fault here belonged to. "I'm sorry," he said. 
He reached to help take his shoes off, letting his feathers take it to the entranceway while he prepared some hot water for tea.
"Go ahead and wash up," he said, "I'll order some take-out, okay?" 
Midoriya frowned, "I can keep going-"
"I know," Hawks nodded his head. "I know you can." 
The look of confusion on his face made that awful feeling twist, like something was rotting inside of him. 
"Please," he said, "Just... go wash up. We'll talk about it when you come back out."
Midoriya pursed his lips, but ultimately, stood up and hobbled for the bathroom. The offer to join him sat in his mouth, but it felt too bitter to come out properly. He turned around, pulling his phone out to make the order, and heard the bathroom door close somewhere behind him.
What the hell was he doing?
He didn't even know where to begin with how wrong this all was.

-

Midoriya came out of the shower, looking a little more refreshed. 
"Did you take it out?" Hawks asked.
Midoriya flushe, and shook his head.
"G..." God that's hot, "Go take it out."
The student returned to the bathroom, and Hawks tried not to think about how hot it was. Encouraging himself to not jump the kid, he impatiently waited for the food to arrive. 

-

"So uh," Hawks said, once they were situated with food at the kitchen table. "I'm sorry."
"Hawks-san," Midoriya replied back, surprised, "No, I'm the one-"
Hawks lifted his hand up. "Please let me finish," he said. 
There was a brief silence but Midoriya nodded and Hawks started again. Standing up, he moved next to Midoriya and bowed properly.
"I'm sorry for how I was acting earlier. That... That wasn't okay. You were uncomfortable and unhappy, and I kept pushing. That was my bad."
"It's nothing to apologize about, Hawk-san," Midoriya said, "I... I didn't say anything to discourage you either, so it's just as much my fault."
Hawks' hands shot to grab his shoulders.
"No, no, no, if I made you think that, it's still my fault. I..." Hawks kneeled in front of him, looking up at Midoriy as earnestly and honestly as possible. "You shouldn't think like that. I'm older than you, and I was the one that pushed you. I'm sorry. We can try again later, but this isn't something we should do without talking. That was my bad."
"Hawks-san," Midoriya simled back, "I already told you, it's fine," he said. "C'mon, the food is getting cold."
Hawks stared at him for a moment longer and took a seat opposite of him. 
More that some pretty words, Hawks understood that his actions needed to speak louder.

"...They never stay," Twice said.
Midoriya frowned, and turned to face him. "Jin, why didn't you ever follow?"
"I... I what?"
The young man looked wrong-footed, like he knew he was charting through unknown waters, but he regained his confidence and spoke clearly.
"I... I obviously don't know who [they] are, or what happened before," he said, staring Twice head on, "but I know you, Jin." 
Twice stared, wide-eyed.
"You say that they never stayed, but you never mentioned if you ever tried to follow them either."
The blond stared at him. Unexpectedly, the answer was glaringly obvious. 
"Oh," he said. 
"We can't do anything about the past," Midoriya continued, "and I'm not saying that it's your fault either. Just that... There might have been other options. We just, don't know what we don't know," he said, waving his hands in front of him. "And there's nothing wrong with that."
Arms falling limp by his side, Twice stared at Midoriya for a long time.
"I won't mess this up anymore," he promised. "I'll stay with you."
And Midoriya, who was younger than him and smaller and weaker, smiled up at him, and Twice felt like he was born to witness one flower bloom.
"Where do you wanna go?" the blond asked. "Wherever, anywhere, let's go together."
And because Midoriya was young, innocent, naive, and full of a hope for an impossible future that wans't [his], he grinned back.
"Let's do that."
People die alone, but they live together.
