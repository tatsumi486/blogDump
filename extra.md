Not for the first time, Izuku couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. He stood up and stepped back from the maps he hung around the former second-year classroom. He had hung the maps up a long time ago, but othertime, the others had added other maps as they found them as well. Eyebrows furrowed, he mentally mapped out the way patrols had been running. He thought about it, the things that were mentioned and tried to think of what wasn't. 
Eventually, he couldn't get an answer until he wrote out all the streetnames and then started to crossreference. Within a few hours, he had an answer. Getting up to his feet, he couldn't believe that no one had been checking around the small mall by southside. 
In the time it took to get out of the area and down the street, he already had four people following him. He really did wish that they had better things to do.

Enji had heard that Izuku had gotten badly injured.

"This is why humans are so..." Akhos stopped himself and gave a sigh. 
Rex, clutching the bin he was emptying his stomach in, flipped him off. "You can... leave anytime."
"If you got the energy to fight, get better," Malos called as he walked in, "Got some water for you."
Rex gave this garbled sound as a response.

"...The truth is," Rex opened his shirt and placed his hand on the emerald core crystal in his chest, "I was Pyra... Mythra's Driver," he said. "In exchange for my life, she wanted to stop fighting, and stop feeling Drivers die."
Malos stared at the core crystal, expression unreadable.
"So I did. I didn't die then, because of her," he looked up, "so as far as the Empire's concerned, I broke her and tossed her into the cloud sea."
The look of contempt on the others' faces were twisted by morbid fascination.
"She asked me, before she went, to find their brother and protect him."
His eyes turned up to Malos.
"So, I'll do that too."
"...Kid, do you even know who their brother is?"
"A guy I just broke out of prison," Rex replied with a cheeky grin. "Don't worry, I have a plan on getting her back."
"Really?"
"I'm going to find Eyisum," he said. "End this... this shitty war for resources and livable land. Then, in a new era of peace, I'll find her again."
"...And then what?"
"I'll let her know that her brother likes apple pies as much as she does. And for as long as I can, I'll protect that peace for her."
Malos, Blade of Destruction, wanted to laugh. He wanted to point and laugh because it was such a pipedream. It was naive and stupid. It was everything he expected children to grow out of.
Instead, he saw Rex. Rex, who had scars from where the chain dug into his thin wrists, looked at Malos the same way he did when he first came into that godforsaken prison cell.
"...Alright," he said, ignoring the indiginant cries behind him, "I say that, but you're my Driver. Where you go, is where I go."
Rex stared at him for a moment, his eyes filling with tears, and he gave a curt nod. A watery laugh escaped from his lips.
"Thank you," he said, as he pressed the palms of his hands to his eyes, "Really. Thank you."
Malos placed his hand on Rex's head, and slowly pulled him closer. Resting his head against his chest, the man spoke loudly, as though his voice could vanquish the cold fear that wrapped around his heart.
"Yes, yes, you're very welcome! I am the Greatest after all. Come on, say it."
"You're kidding me," Rex gawked back. 
Malos grin was bright and knowing.
"Oh my god, okay, you're the greatest!" the young man said, trying to sound as sarcastic as possible but failing as his lips curled into a grin and he laughed.
"They totally forgot that we're here," Akhos said.
