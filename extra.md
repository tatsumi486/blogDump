### APOC

"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

### withering

Midoriya crouched down in front of him. His arm sat in a sling, where the burn itched more than anything else. However, if Midoriya did anything with it, several people would come tracking him down, looking to be in more pain than himself. Drama queens, all of them.
"What do you want?" Dabi said, dispassionate and almost bored. Midoriya wondered if he was always this easy to read, or his Dabi really was falling apart.
"Are you sulking?" the young man asked. Dabi's frown widened and Midoriya tilted his head to the side. "Amazing, you're handsome even when you sulk."
That got a response. He scowled.
"Say your piece and go away," he snapped back. 
The young man shook his head, "I don't want to."
"...Why?"
Because Dabi didn't look like he wanted to be alone. Or maybe it's because Midoriya hated how accustomed to lonliness Dabi seemed to be. There was a lot of reasons, but there was only one that Dabi probably would have accepted from Midoriya.
"Because you look even more handsome when you're annoyed."
Dabi's eyebrows twitched, and for a second, it looked like he would smile and look at Midoriya. 
"You know what my hands can do, don't you?" Dabi asked instead. "I could do it again, you idiot."
But Dabi said "idiot" like a normal person would say "I love you." 
"You wouldn't," Midoriya replied back, "Because I enjoyed it."
Dabi's head snapped up at that, summer blue eyes looking like stained glass set to dry and Midoriya grinned back.
"And you wouldn't do anything that I like, would you, Dabi?"
Dabi did this shuddering breath, something that woud look like accepted defeat on a human being but most definately could not be that on Dabi. What did Dabi have to lose anyways? Midoriya couldn't imagine Dabi losing anything because he didn't care about anything-
"...I love you," Dabi said, burying his face in his hands. "There, I said it. Go away. Never come back."
Midoriya stared at him, his heart breaking. He could hardly believe it. 
When Dabi said "I love you," it sounded a lot like "please don't leave me."
"No way," Midoriya said, scooting closer. Crouching right in front of Dabi, he peered up at him curiously.
Dabi glared at him, and Midoriya wondered how anyone would believe that Dabi loved him when he glared like that. He smiled at the thought.
"Just go," Dabi said, his voice cracking.
"I don't want to," Midoriya said, "Because then I have to wait another week before I get to see you again."
Dabi brought his head up slowly. His eyes wide, he opened his mouth and then closed it. It was a good look on him. Patiently, Midoriya smiled up at him. He was a little nicer than Dabi, letting him have the time to slowly sort through his feelings. Just a little, of course.
Dabi released his laugh, watery and thick like it was stuck in his throat. 
"You're awful," he said, but his eyes shined like the sun would never set. "Terrible," he reached out to Midoriya, and looked at Midoriya with a child-like awe when Midoriya took his hand and came closer. "Horrible," he muttered, eyes trailing from his lips to his eyes. 
The face of a demon who fell in love was surprisingly human. He smelled like smoke and his hands trembled when they latched onto Midoriya's hips. He kissed him slowly the first time, and then, like a wildfire, surged back with a force and a heat that had Midoriya weak in the knees. Heartbeat thundering away, he wrapped his arms around Dabi and flinched when the man moaned against his lips. 
He pulled back, "Dabi?" curious and a little concerned that he was injured somewhere they didn't mend, and Dabi bit his lips again. 
"I love you," he said again, and like a magic spell, Midoriya felt his body melt in his arms. "Izuku," he kissed his ear, "I love you."
"You're... ridiculous," Midoriya huffed back. "C'mon, I wanna do it on a bed."
"You're moving this too fast," Dabi sighed, pulling away but keepings his hands on Midoriya's waist like he didn't know how to let go. "Do'nt be this easy for anyone else."
"I'm not going to answer that question."
Dabi laughed back, a rich sound that felt too innocent for someone with a face like his.
"Then, I guess I'll just teach your body that there's no one better than me."
The taller man came to kiss his temple before releasing him to grab his hand.
"Let's go."
"Impatient, are we?"

-

There was a rush of air, and Midoriya's entire vision was covered by red. 
"Boo," a whisper came to his ear as hands came to his hips. 
Midoriya smiled back. "Oh no, I'm so scared," he said, turning over his shoulder. "I wish someone could come and save me."
"Well lucky you," Hawks grinned back, letting Midoriya turn around in his arms. "You got Number Three right here."
"Lucky," Midoriya drawled out slowly, "Right, that's the word I would use."
Hawks pouted, and leaned in to give him a loud kiss on his cheek. Before pulling back, he nipped his earlobe sharply. His arms came tightly around Midoriya's arms, pinning them down to his side, and blew a raspberry against his neck.
Midoriya shrieked with laughter, and Hawks laughed back.
"What about now?" he asked, eyes shining.
"If I get a real kiss," Midoriya replied back, eyes shining, "I might have an answer."
"Well, I guess I can do something about that.


### kind nightmare

"What about your hero thing?"
"I won't be a hero," Midoriya replied back, "I'm going to transfer out of UA at the end of the semester to the public school."
The silence was stiffling.
"But... didn't you... really want to be a hero?" Shigarki asked quietly.
"I do," Midoriya said, "But I don't think someone who rapes others, keeps people imprisoned in their closet, or justifies murder by saying "it doesn't look like a person" would made a good hero. I won't make a good hero. If I really wanted to do the right thing, I should be marched into a police station to face my crimes, but I don't... I don't even have the courage to do that."
His tone was calm, but Shigaraki could see the way his hands were trembling.
"Then, what are you going to do?"
Midoriya stared at Shigaraki and gave a half-hearted smile, "First, I'm going to clear this dungeon, and get my mom home. Then, I'll put my head down and apologize to her that I turned out to be scum. Regardless of whether she accepts it or not, I'll probably leave." He shrugged back, eyes falling back forward to his homework. "And I'll leave before I ruin anyone else's life."
A hand suddenly grabbed the back of his neck and Shigaraki stared at him.
"What about me? You're just going to abandon me here? Domesticate me to be your little house-wife, and now that you don't wanna play house anymore, you're going to just throw me away?"
"O-Of course not! But when this clears out, you should be able to be yourself again, and all this-"
"Why are you so certain that I'm like this because of that dungeon-"
"Because there's no way this would have happened otherwise! You would have never come to me and you would have never stayed! No one," and something dark and ugly came creeping out but it choked Midoriya out and finally came spilling out, "ever chooses to stay!"
"Then, when we find your mom? And the mystery of the dungeon? And all that figures out?" Shigaraki growled out, reaching out to grab Midoriya's hand and placing it against his heart, "and you learn that I haven't changed? Would you believe me then?"
Midoriya hesitated. 
"If you're going to reject me, then reject me!" Shigaraki snapped back, "If you can't give me an answer then don't give me hope!" 
Midoriya hesitated, and Shigaraki suppressed the urge to just scream. 
"I love you, you dumbass! Just because it's inconvienet for you doesn't mean it's not true! I-I-" he stared, and Midoriya flinched backwards but it didn't stop Shigaraki, "... Don't leave me behind."
The same way Midoriya was waiting for his mom to come back, tell him everything was okay, and all that, he wondered if Shigaraki was waiting for the something similar. His heart ached. This was the man that came crashing into his class's exercise? 
Shigaraki, who gave up All For One's position, ended a long and unseen war. He came closer, leaning his head against the top of Midoriya's head. His figure trembled, but he didn't reach out to hold the younger man.
And Midoriya, who ruined Shigaraki. 
"...I'll do it," he said, "I'll take responsibility."
Whatever that meant, he supposed. Whatever they wanted, he guessed. He owed them that much.
"For ruining your life, I'll give you mine."
Shigaraki stared at him for a moment longer. He opened his mouth, closed it, and then covered his face. 
"Ruin?" he said, "You didn't ruin me." And his voice break, "How come, when other people feel it, it's beautiful but when it's me, when I fall in love, you call it ruin?"
Shigaraki shook his head.

### way back home 

And then, suddenly, Aizawa heard it. A loud laugh that was as sudden as it was unpredictable. Feeling sucker-punched and breathless, he felt his entire world slow down. Just a few feet in front of him, laughing so hard that he was bent over and leaning against the guardrails was Midoriya.
Midoriya smiled so brightly. His laugh was so light. It rang in his head and hooked into his heart. It shook him up and he couldn't stop staring. His hands trembled. 
so that's what Midoriya looked like, sounded like, when he laughed without any inhibitions. It made something in his chest loosen, but it also brought forth a wave of rage.
What could Shirakumo possibly do that he could make that sound come out? It wasn't fair. Aizawa could be funny. It wasn't impossible for him. And he could be a thousand times better than Shirakumo could ever be. They've known each other for longer, and they once watched the sun rise together, so Aizawa just didn't understand.
"Whoa, Shota," Yamada nudged him with his elbow, eyebrows furrowed in their concern, "Jealousy is not a good look on you."
It was a playful jab, but all Aizawa could see was Midoriya. His pearly whites and the pinks of his cheeks and the red of his mouth.

-

But where people struggled with the concept of responsibility, there was Midoriya, who took it to the next level.
"Stop being so responsible," Toyomitsu said, his hands on Midoriya's shoulders. He was trembling under the effort and the guilt of those he couldn't protect but Midoriya was small enough that when he placed his hands on his shoulders, his fingers could touch on his back. Midoriya was small, and never faltered to shoulder responsibility, "Please. I'm begging you. Run away, Izuku. Don't get involved and-"
"...I don't think I ever told you," Midoriya suddenly spoke up, and he grinned like there wasn't blood running down his face and smeared on his neck. Midoriya, who smiled shyly at the ground when he asked Toyomitsu if he wanted to stay for dinner, grinned at him, boyish and free, "but I'm really grateful that we got to meet. I feel so inspired, whenever we get to meet. I feel really lucky."
Toyomitsu stared back, his arms slackening.
"I wanna... laugh together with everyone," he said, "and that means that I have to put in that much effort too. Running away won't change anything."
If the entire world was as half as responsible as Midoriya, Toyomitsu wondered if there would be any crime left in the world. 
"The future exists because of the things we do today," he said, a grin on his face, "and the past exists because we it made who we are today."
One of his hands came up to Toyomitsu's face, wiping at his eyes gently while his other arm laid broken in his lap.
"Don't cry, Fatgum-san, we're okay."


-

"...You didn't peg me as the loyal kind," Kan admitted.
"...I'm not," Aizawa replied back. 
He was quiet for a moment, "Then, why are you trying so hard for him?"
Aizawa placed his head in his hands, "I'm not." In his mind eye, without even trying, he could see the small smile on Midoriya's face, and he hated himself.
Kan's pitying gaze made him feel even worse.

### way back home - ver Deku

"What should we get?" Yamada asked as he entered the restaraunt. 
"Oooh, that smells so good," Bubaigawara hummed, "Whatever that smell is!"
"What about you, Midoriya? You in the mood for some curry?" 
The young man's face paled, and Aizawa glared at Shirakumo, like it was his fault.
"I... I don't really like curry," he admitted.
"Really?" Aizawa's head snapped to him, eyes wide in his surprise. 
Midoriya leaned back and towards Yamada, who started to grin like a fool, and gave a shy nod.
"Oh," he said, feeling heavy. "Your curry tasted really good," he said. 
"I don't cook," Midoriya replied back, and then realized, "Oh, Before Me did, did he?"
"Alright, alright, can we sit and order?" Yamada asked, an arm around Midoriya as he carefully pulled him to the chair. "Here you are, Deku-sweetheart, sit next to me today, alright?"
Green eyes were wary when they turned to Aizawa, but softened as an exapserated sigh broke from his lips.
"You're ridiculous."
