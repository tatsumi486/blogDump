"I'm quirkless," Midoriya replied, waving his hand. 
"You don't want to change that?"
The young man laughed back, a sounds bright and small like Christmas lights on in the dead of the night. 
"No way," he said, "I don't want to be invincible."

### returning a gift

It had been six months.
Six months and two weeks and four days, but Dabi didn't keep track of time that didn't matter to him.

-

"Sorry," Dabi said, leaning against the wall with his hand on the bloody wound. The stench of burnt flesh filled the air, telling all of them how far Dabi would go for this, "but I promised someone that I wouldn't die."
But none of these bastards would ever need to know that Dabi had better things to lie about.

-

"But it's Thursday," Twice said, his voice growing quiet as he scuffed his shoe on the ground, "We always eat dinner together on Thursday."
Midoriya blinked twice and then smiled back.
"Yeah," he said, "You're right." He looked down at the papers in front of him and gave a breathless laugh. 

-

Midoriya stared at Kouta for a moment before he smiled back.
"It's not like just because you're small, your problems are small. If that was the case, the world would be easier to predict."
He placed his hand on Kouta's back, a warmth that Kouta hadn't felt in a long while, and tears sprang into his eyes. 
"...If you're having a hard time, you're having a hard time," the older man said, patting his back with his fingers before he let him go.
"...What... should I do?"
"Kouta-kun, Midoriya grinned at him, "the answer to that question will decide the kind of man you become."

Midoriya stared up at the building, a relic of the past now, and gaped.
Aizawa had some fuzzy memories about it, things that he kept away because it was too scary to remember what he didn't have anymore. 
Next to him, however, was a kid that would never understand and would never know. Staring up with stars in his eyes, he wondered it was easier to never have lost, or to love and to lose.
His hand came to grab Midoriya's hand, their fingers interlacing, and he wondered.
The world didn't look so dark anymore.

Kurogiri frowned and then told Shigaraki, "Are you hurt?"
"Huh?" Shigaraki frowned back and looked at Kurogiri like he suddenly grew a face, "No." Tilting his head, he then followed up with a, "Why?"
"There's blood on your clothes," Kurogiri replied, "Sensei entrusted your health to me, Shigaraki Tomura. If you are injured, I need to ensure your continued wel-being, and report to Sensei to accept my punishment in failing him."
And normally, Shigaraki would have said something rude, possibly a deagratory phrase about Kurogiri being a little dog. Contrary to expectations, however, instead, he turned to face him.
"How do you get blood off clothes?" he asked.
Kurogiri, if he had eyes, would have stared and blinked at him, waiting for his brain to kick in and inform him that this was an illusion of some sort. 

-

"Hah!" Shigaraki's voice was sharp and haughty. His chest puffed out and he gave a wide grin, brimming with pride. "You're just useless without me," he said, and Midoriya had never heard someone say it so happily before, "Jeez, you can't even do your own laundry. Lucky fucking you, one of your fuck toys is actually useful."
"F-fuck to-" Midoriya choked as Shigaraki took his sweaters and shirts and whistled as he carried them to the laundry unit. 
"All this fucking All Might," he grumbled and growled.
And Midoriya, who didn't even know that his mom used fabric softener, would finally wear something soft for the first time in a while.

-

"Hey, where's the sweater you were wearing earlier?" Shigaraki asked.
"Uh... I put it in the bin. The white one," Midoriya replied, but when he looked like he was

"Dabi," Midoriya's eyes shined as he whispered his name out, "Come here." He beckoned him closer with a hand. 
Dabi did so, a little curious to see what captured his attention, and looked through the branches to see what had caught his eye. 
"What's up?" he asked, voice quiet.
He looked out, eyes taking in the open lake underneath a peaceful sunny day. Not too long ago, he'd burn this whole thing down just because he hated how perfect it looked. Today, he was looking for what could have possibly caught Midoriya's gaze.
"Do you see them?" Midoriya asked quietly, voice brimming with joy. "The little ducklings there, following the mama-duck around."
Dabi blinked, and finally found a small family of ducks carefully swimming about.
"They're so cute," he said quietly, like speaking too loudly would disturb the scene in front of them.
"You think that's cute?" Dabi asked, because they were just little fluffballs floating down the surface of the water. He didn't really see them as anything. It wasn't like they would be much of a snack either.
"You... don't think so?"
Dabi turned to stare at Midoriya, the patch of sunlight that landed on his cheek, the smudge of dirt across his forehead, and a dark bruise on his neck where he left it earlier that morning.
He hummed.
"I've seen something cuter," he replied. "Something so cute that nothing seems to be cute anymore."
"Really?" Midoriya tilted his head, shitty ducklings all forgotten and his entire focus on Dabi.
"Yeah," Dabi said, leaning in for a quick kiss. He stared at him for a moment, watched the red paint his cheeks, and stood up. "Too damn cute."
And his grin must have been too wide and Midoriya's cheeks too dark, because Aizawa gave him the dirtiest glare yet.
All in a day's work.

-

Aizawa took a deep, long breath. In through his nose and out through his mouth, before he just squinted at the situation, as though something was wrong with his eyes and he just didn't understand the situation.
With how easily Midoriya seemed to take things into stride, he was starting to think that he was the strange one. 
"

-

They sat against the side of the mountain, chest panting hard from the impromptu tumbling that they took. 
"Wow," Midoriya said, craning his head up and already up on his feet, "That was... a really big slide."
And on the cusp of losing his mind after a really close encounter with death, Aizawa's lips twisted into a grin and he started to chuckle. He ran his hand thorugh his hair, feeling like he was possessed or something as an unfamiliar feeling bubbled up from inside him. 
"Yeah," he said, covering his eyes as he tried to control 

-

"...A vampire," Aizawa deadpanned.
"It's okay," Midoriya replied, hands in front of his chest as he stood in front of his newest addition, "We made a [Blood Pact], so he won't drink your blood."
"A-a [Blood Pact]?" Fatgum gasped, his hand flying to cover his mouth, and the vampire, if at all possible, looked even paler.
Aizawa covered his face with his hand, pinched his temples, took a deep breath, and Dabi spoke up next. 
"Easy enough to dispell," he said, lifting his hand up. An abundance of blue flames came across his fingers.
"No, no, no," Midoriya said, "He's on our side!"
"Your side," Fatgum said, "No like literally, he can't leave your side."
"It's just until he finds a place he wants to settle in."
Aizawa couldn't believe that someone who looked as innocent as Midoriya could give such a bold-faced lie.
"I'm sure," Dabi, one of the worst offenders, deadpanned. Aizawa resisted hissing at him.
After all, right now, they needed to ban together. They can go back to in-fighting in a few moments.
And then, to their shock, Midoriya reached to grab the vampire's hand. 
"It's okay," he said, voice quiet. "Are you sure this won't kill you?"
And Vlad King, who stared at his hand like he was expecting to wake up from this dream, gave a shallow nod. He took a step out.
There was a moment of silence, and the vampire laughed, his eyes watering.
"My Solar Eclipse," he mumbled quietly, "I can finally step under the sun." He rushed for Midoriya, grabbing him and hefting him up with little to no difficulty. The yelp of surprise was a whisper underneath the thunder of Vlad's laughter as he spun the two around. "The sun!" he laughed, "Is so warm and bright!"
And although he was a little surprised, Midoriya smiled at the taller man and rubbed his back.

>> ending limited collection w/ Aizawa becoming free? 

"Finally," Aizawa said, hands coming up to cup Midoriya's face, "I've been waiting for this."
He leaned in, kissing his lips and ruining the kiss by laughing.
"Thank you," he said, "for saving me."
His throat burned, his eyes watering, and it was like everything was suddenly returned to him, all at once. 
And at the center of it all was Midoriya and his bright green eyes.
"I love you," he said. 
The rest of his life, he thought to himself, would be adorned with a Spring that couldn't wilt.
