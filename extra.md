It was expected to fight. Of course it was expected to fight. He used to be a Hero. Protect people was first and foremost. 
And still, Deatharms felt exhausted. He couldn't lift his arms past his elbows. The weight that laid across his shoulders might as well have been a noose, and he should have died a long time time ago. 
Before, when life didn't feel like prelude, he thought that he could handle anything. Now, he understood that it was a delusion.

"I have to protect you! I have to-"
"No! You really don't!"

"I should have done this a long time ago," Enji said, "I'm sorry." He bowed fully, right at his waist, "I was a terrible father. There is no excuse. I'm sorry."
"I don't know how many times you people are going to make me say this," Dabi said, leaning against the wall as he stared out at the wall in front of him. His eyes trailed to the ground, "Your Touya-kun is dead," he said, "Don't replace him so easily."
Still, Enji didn't straighten.
Heavy with an emotion that didn't belong to [Dabi], Dabi turned away. What a farce.
"But if I was Touya," he said quietly, even though he wasn't, "I'd ask you what took you so fucking long."
Enji slowly straightened, and Dabi manaded to meet his eyes. Two pair of eyes, just a shade of blue different, met briefly.
"And instead of chasing after a ghost, you should just worry about the living."
Dabi left then and there, before he did something that [Dabi] wouldn't do.

The words that he wanted to hear so badly, 
"Here."
Dabi looked up to where Twice was handing him his share of jerky.
"...What's this?" he asked, taking it.
"You look like you're going through some shit," Twice explained, "so here. You need energy to deal with shit."
"Don't you need energy to deal with your shit too?"
"Aw, Dabi, you do care!" Another Twice called out from the back.
Right before Dabi could even scowl, the blond grinned back.
"Cause I care, too! So when you can't take care of yourself, I'll do it!"
"I won't do the same for you," Dabi said.
Twice grinned back, his hand coming out to ruffle through Dabi's hair. with a scowl, his hand was batted away, but Twice's eyes were unwordly bright. Just loking at him, Dabi would never believe that he used to be a criminal. It felt wrong to think that a villain could have such a beaming smile.
"That's fine."
There was a word to describe the type of tragedy Dabi was certain that Twice would fall into. Dabi would ensure that he wouldn't fall into it. Not because he cared, but because he would have the spare energy for it. That's all.
Biting into the jerky, he wondered how he would define family.

"You said," Eri's hand were tight on his shirt, tugging insesitently. Vaguely, in the corner of his mind, Midoriya thought that the material would stretch. "You said Kabi Killer."
Midoriya stared at her like she had grown another head. Running the words in his head, he tried his best to find rhyme, reason, literally anything, because there had to be a clue here-
"What the fuck is a Kabi Killer?" Twice hissed out.
"...This is useless," Dabi sighed.
Eri deflated, but Midoriya looked contemplative. 
"...Sorry, Eri. You must be disappointed," he said, kneeling down in front of her, "I'm not smart enough to figure this out. Could you give me another hint?"
She hesitated
