"Another gate?" Natsuo asked as he passed the bowl of rice over to his brother. He took a seat in front of him, as the two prepared to eat all the take-out they ordered. "Are you even taking breaks?"
"He didn't come to today's gate, so I didn't bother," Touya said as he swiped through his phone. "I thought he went to the Friday afternoon ones, but he didn't show this time."
No way.
"Are you going to gates to see Midoriya?" Natsuo asked, feeling like he was in the wrong body.
"Hm? No, don't be stupid. There's four gate openings tomorrow. I'll travel through them" Touya said, but five years in a gate did nothing for his tells. Touya tried to be nonchalant, but he had already changed the topic.
And, as it always did when Touya mentioned going through a gate, Natsuo felt his stomach twist. 
He thought about Midoriya, the type of kid who was so thin that he would disappear if he turned sideways. 
"I'm out of lectures after 2pm," he said, "I'll join you then."
Touya arched an eyebrow at him, and nodded back. As though, now that it wasn't about Midoriya, there was nothing to say. 
Natsuo felt so stupid. It was never about Gates. Gates were just a convienent way for him to meet Midoriya. 
"Just get his number," Natsuo said, and then stopped. They got phones when they were in middle school, and the five years didn't introduce something extremely complicated, so there was no reason why he shouldnt know how to use a phone, right? Maybe Natsuo had totally and completely overlooked something incredibly important.
"I tried," his brother replied behind his bowl. "He said he didn't have a phone."
Natuso winced. If he's never heard that kind of bullshit before...
He didn't blame Touya. If he wanted to find (read: stalk) Midoriya, he would have to do it the old-fashioned way and become the guy who was always convienently in the same place at the same time.

-

"Is... being outside hard for you?" Midoriya suddenly asked. "You're here all the time. Even the food-truck ladies recognize you. Is it because it's hard being out of a Gate?"
Natsuo choked because that was a conversation he can't just drop onto his brother. That wasn't something that people should just ask someone that they always happen to meet up with at a gate. It was impolite. It was wrong. 
"I got the usual shebang. Nightmares and restlessness," Touya replied back evenly, shrugging as they made their way further into the dungeon. "Being home is nice. I don't worry as much about getting ambushed by monsters and the temperature is stable. But there's not as much mana. It feels suffocating."
No, what was wrong was the fact that strangers and hunter coworkers could get an answer for a question that always got stuck in Natsuo's throat. He didn't know that Touya wasn't sleeping well. He couldn't tell, since his brother looked about the same as he did when he came home. 
They had all just assumed that he wouldn't want to go back to a Gate or ever be associated with one again. Since he spent five long years in a plae surrounded by monsters and other awful things. 
Come to think about it, what did Touya miss? Of all the things, he never asked about that either. 
He just figured that this would be the case. It just didn't make sense.
How could being in a Gate be better than being at home? But when Natuso thought about home, it was never that he wanted to return. 
Once he stopped thinking like how everyone wantd him to think, and started to think like 
Midoriya stared at him, and reached into his pocket. "After the second gate, I saw that your magic wasn't stabilizing, so I figured that it would be something like that."
Touya extended his hand out, and a bright blue gemstone of some kind came into his hand. In Midoriya's hand, he barely managed to wrap his fingers all the way around it, but it was easy for Touya.
"It'll help with the mana. Keep it with you when you're sleeping. It's just my mana, but when you're in gates, it'll regain some mana."
There was a long pause, as Touya stared at the rock and Midoriya rattled facts off about it.
"Not saying that you have to, or that it's a one-cure treatment, but if the problem is the mana descreptency, holding onto something like this might be helpful, especially since you've been exposed so much to mana to begin with. And I'm not going to creep on you or anything, it doesn't have any other real special features. But if you want, I can-"
"Thanks, Midoriya," Touya said, his voice so quiet that, if they weren't hunters with heightened hearing, no one would have heard him.
Midoriya beamed back, looking ten years too long to be out fighting monsters. 
Natsuo was beginning to understand that Midoriya didn't bring Touya back home. Midoriya gave Touya a reason to leave that gate.

-

"I've been meaning to ask this for a while but Midoriya," Natsuo brought up as they ate sandwhiches (bought using Enji's credit card) on a picnic blanket (brought by Natsuo), "what school do you do to?"
Midoriya stilled. "Uh..."
Natsuo, who thought that this was a good topic of discussion, wasn't sure what to think about the fact that Midoriya was breaking into sweat coming up with an answer.
"It was a stupid question," Touya said, "Ignore him."
Natsuo's eyebrows furrowed because it was a perfectly reasonable question. Touya didn't have to be such a dick about it. Well, considering that his brother was a trauma victim, reexperiencing his trauma to begin with,  Natsuo supposed he could cut him some slack.
But at the same time, he was curious about Midoriya. He wanted to know about the guy who brought his brother back. There were a lot of landmines that he couldn't bring up with Touya, and even more sore subjects that he didn't want to talk about either. No matter how much Touya trusted and looked after Midoriya, that didn't mean that Natsuo trusted him. 
Yeah, Midoriya might have saved his brother. But his brother wouldn't have gone back to a gate if it wasn't for him either.
"I don't go to school," Midoriya said.
Natsuo could feel Touya's piercing gaze, even without looking at him. Look, he didn't do any coaxing. Midoriya spoke out of his own freewill.
"I... uh... dropped out," he continued quietly, "so I would have more time to enter gates."
From the way Touya stared at Midoriya, Natsuo could figure that he didn't know about this. You're welcome, Touya, he thought to himself bitterly. 
"How often do you go?"
"Once every two days," Midoriya replied quietly. "There's a lot of E-Rank gates that the Commission sponsors."
"You need money?" Touya asked. 
The young man gave a sheepish smile. "Doesn't everyone?"
"Midoriya, we're planning on taking on some D-Rank Gates later this week. Maybe even a C-Rank. If you're not busy, do you wanna come with us?"
Midoriya leapt up to his feet. "Really?" he asked, eyes wide in his excitement. And, catching how surprised they looked, immediately backed down. "Uhm, I mean, tha tis, if you don't mind, I think that would be-"
"We don't know any good supporters," Natsuo said, "Both of us have been out of the picture and stuff. It'd mean a lot to us if you could make the time to come with us."
"Let's decide on the rest of the details when we get out," Touya said.
It felt different, hearing something like that from Touya. 

-

"Oh, are you... guys going today too?" Fuyumi asked, and he knew okay, he knew. The look on her face, he got it. "Aren't you getting ready for midterms?" she asked.
"I'm going to take the rest of the semester off," Natsuo said.
"What?" Fuyumi snapped back with much more anger than he was expecting. "Why? No, I mean... It's just. Are you going to become a hunter? This isn't what's going to help Touya-nii-"
"Fuyumi," Natsuo cut in, "Why are you saying that now? Then, were you trying to help Niichan too, by never talking to him and never meeting up with him? Are the flowers you sent to the hospital and the fruit you gave him everything he needed to be better now? Should he just jump into society again and become an officer worker somewhere where he never has to enter a gate again? Does that sound like he's healed?"
"That's not what I meant, Natsuo! You know that!"
"No, I don't, neechan! What did you mean?"
"I don't want to lose you both to Gates!"
"Lose me? What would you lose? A brother?" 
Her face fell.
Natsuo shook his head.
"Nothing Fuyumi. When Niichan got lost in a gate, we didn't lose anything. When Niichan came back, we didn't gain anything either."
In the echoing silence of the Todoroki Manor, Natsuo found his family.
"...Later, Fuyumi."
And walked out the same way he always did. 

-

Natsuo stood in front of Midoriya, because a Tanker's job was to shield his partymembers from aggros and take on any damage. Standing in front of Midoriya, glaring down the person who dared to think and believe that they could come after his supporter.
"W-what? Who the hell are you?"
"Well, it's been some time since I've needed to introduce myself," Touya's voice came like a bucket of cold water. His magic flooded the area in an instant, as he wrapped his arm around the shoulders of the man. Undoubtedly, he could see the startling similarities between Natsuo and Touya now, the only pair of A-Rank siblings that partied together in this corner of Japan.
"T-The... Todo... Todoroki-sans?"
"Ara? So you knew after all?"
The man's eyes fell to Midoriya, the silver of Midoriya he could catch from where he was carefully hidden behind Natsuo's builk.
"Oh. Oh my god. M-Midoriya-sama."
There was nothing kind or forgiving in the gazes that either Todoroki gave the man.
"But, I guess since you don't want to make a deal with us, there's no point to it," Touya sighed. He took a step back, walking towards Midoriya with an exaggerated shrug. "What can we do, Izuku? They don't want to deal with customers like us."
Midoriya nodded, his shoulders drooping, "Oh, okay."
Touya's hand came to his head, ruffling curls as his expression softened. 
"Wasted trip, I know. Let's get some ice cream before we head back. I'm sure there's other places we can sell those lamias to."
"W-Wait, please!"
Natsuo stepped in front of the man again, cold gaze looking down at him. The man recoiled. Sweat beaded from every pour in his body.
"No, I mean, please, sir. Truly, I am so sorry. Please forgive me-"
When an S-Ranker left the building, the whole world would know that this was a place that an S-Ranker wouldn't stay for more than ten minutes. That would be enough to cripple their business, if it didn't shut down in its entirety. Since two of the Todorokis were involved, in addition to the only S-Rank Supporter in the world, it was going to recieve additional pressure from all sides. Their stocks will plummet. They will flounder. For this man specificially, it was going to be incredibly difficult to find a job, especially with hunters, ever again.
Natsuo figured it was the least that should happen to anyone who ever saw Midoriya and thought that he was an easy target.

-

"You're not getting sprinkles this time?" Touya asked, a frown on his face.
"Oh, I want a waffle cone."
"The dipped ones are pretty good," Natsuo said, pointing to the cones on display. "I think I'm going to get my sundae..."
"Your shitty pitaschio ice cream," Touya muttered under his breath.
"... in the waffle bowl."
"Just one?" Touya arched an eyebrow. Why was he so hostile? Couldn't they fight in a dungeon and get along elsewhere? If they got into a fight here, the street would be a crater in the ground.
"Yeah, we're going to that buffet after this, aren't we?"
"You guys are going to a buffet after this?" Midoriya's voice was small but filled to the brim in wonder.
Touya gave Natsuo a dirty look. If he didn't want Natsuo to spill the beans, then he shouldn't have left those coupons out where he could find them. Or better yet, he should have just asked Midoriya out instead of 'waiting for the right time' or whatever.
"Yeah, you want to come too?" Touya asked, "Taking Natsuo to an all-you-can eat buffet is easier on our wallets than it would be to buy him individual food to eat."
"I-I wouldn't want to interuppt..."
Natsuo snorted. That's what Touya deserved. Now Midoriya will think that he was crashing on their brother-bonding time (bullshit), and was being added to the plans because he found out about them. Pitaschio ice cream was fucking delicious.

-

"If you like him that badly, why don't you just ask him out?"
"Because he'll say yes."
There was a long silence that passed through them.
"Isn't that what you want?" Natsuo asked.
Touya was quiet for a long moment.
"Unless... the problem is with you?"
His brother remained dead silent. 
Natsuo hesitated.
"You know, Midoriya's a nice guy. If you asked, I'm sure he'll fix whatever's wrong with... your junk. And to begin with, I don't think he's the type to really care about that kind of thing either, you know?"
"My what?"
"Isn't that you're quiet? Because you can't get your dick up?"
The sound of something thudding caught both of their attention. Whipping around, they met eyes with Fuyumi, who had dropped Natsuo's shield, with several bits of clothes on it. 
"I... I found... your old enchanted clothes," she said. She looked, from Natsuo to the clothes, and then to Touya before she dropped her gaze like she couldn't look at him. "Oh uhm... I... I don't think Midoriya-kun would mind it either-"
Touya covered his face with his hands. "Jesus fucking christ," he sighed.

-

Natsuo stared for a long moment at his drink and then to his brother. 
"Niichan," he called, still a little caught off-guard that he could expect an answer, "I like Midoriya."
Touya downed the rest of his cup.
"I know," he said as soon as his glass touched the table.
"I'm going to ask him out," Natsuo continued.
"Do him good."
"And I'm going to tell him about how you feel too."
"Why?"
"Cause I want you to be happy."
"And so, you think that confessing to the person that I like is going to make me happy?"
Natsuo nodded, "Because Midoriya would accept us."
There was a long pause. Touya sat forward in his seat, eyebrows furrowed as his eyes narrowed.
"Natsuo, you're drunk. Get up, I'm taking you home."
Which was wrong and they both knew it. They were A-Class Hunters, a bottle or eight of sake wasn't going to shake them in the slightest. 
"Niichan-"
"Natsuo. You're drunk. You don't know what you're talking about."
"Is it that bad?" Natsuo asked, because no one would know better than him. 
"It's fine as it is," Touya snapped back.
"But it's not, is it?" he couldn't believe it. Once upon a time, Touya said that he would become an S-Rank before he was 25. Where did that ambition go? In the five years, did he lose that instead of his life? Was the limit of his ambition to just see the next day or something? "Niichan, you know that he's not going to say no, you don't know hwat he'll say at all-"
"That's the problem!" Touya snapped back, his voice silencing the bar. He heaved as the silence slowly receded back and the diner went back to regular volume. "Midoriya doesn't know anything. He'll just accept it as it is because he doesn't know what his options are and he doesn't know how to find them-"
Natsuo shook his head, "Those are just excuses and you know it. Niichan, are you..." he thought about it, the way Touya stopped their march into a dungeon until Midoriya's breathing evened out, and came to an answer. "Are you scared?"
Touya stood up. Dropping a wad of bills (and easily triple their actual bill), his chair screeched behind him as he left. Grabbing his jacket off his chair, long legs powerwalked to the entrance way. He waved at the server, probably telling him that his money was on the table, when Natuso caught up.
"Niichan-"
His hand caught onto his wrist, and Touya dragged him out like that.
The cold winter air came out.
"Just drop it, Natsuo. Go ask him out. I'll give... you my blessing. So make him happy and just leave me out of this-"
"You can make him happy. We can do it together-"
"This isn't a dungeon, Natsuo!"
"No, this is Midoriya!"
The two stood in front of an alleyway, barely a block from the diner. Their breaths came out in puffs in front of their mouths.
"Natsuo, if we do this, there's no way this will end pretty."
Natsuo shook his head, "No, it'll be fine."
Touya gave a breathless laugh, "And how can you be so certain?"
"Because we all want to be happy and we all want to make each other happy. We take it slowly, bit by bit and make sure no one is left behind. The same way we've always done anything."
"This isn't a dungeon, Natsuo," Touya repeated, sounding completely different than when he said it before.
"The stakes are the same"
He laughed, sounding more like he lost.
"Who are you? Where did my little brother who always lost his recorder go?"
"Niichan!" Natsuo spluttered back, partly shocked that Touya would bring up such an old memory, and partly shocked that he remembered something like that at all.
"...Let me sleep on it," Touya said, waving his hand. "I'll have an answer before we Gate-Jump on Monday."


### Gacha 

[Arena] was a special thing. In Midoriya's professional and unbiased opinion, it was a waste of time and a fucking annoyance. 
While he understood the prestige behind it, and the imporance of it, it wasn't something that he wanted or needed. Like, he got it. The money they make from it was good. It gave mages good repetoire, people hailed them as Champions. It help the economy, and all of that.
Coming as someone who remained in the bottom rungs of Bronze for as long as he's been a [Summoner], most people scoff at him to begin with. No one cared about him, and he didn't care about them.
However, he couldn't refuse an invitation from the Council.
"A new season for [Arena] has begun," Midoriya informed his summons, "I'll be gone for a day and a half. Please take care of the Citadel while I'm gone."
"Ah..." Sero looked uncomfortable, "Are you... going to be okay?"
Midoriya's blank expression broke into something soft. He gave a kind smile to his summon.
"Yeah, I'll be fine."
[Arena] was annoying, but it wasn't deliberating. He's done it enough times to know that. 
"Sato's in the kitchen," Sero said, "So let's eat hearty when you come back. Take it easy for the day."
Midoriya laughed back. the two of them making their way to the teleportation gates. All chatter abruptly ended when he caught eye of Shigaraki at the gate. 
Sero tensed considerably next to him, so much that Midoriya wondered if someone casted [Petryfy] on him. 
It was just Shigaraki, wasn't it? Nothing could be crawling around his Citadel without his knowledge.
"Hey, Summoner," Shigaraki called out, a wide grin on his face, "What took you so long? Let's go."
"...Let's... go where?" Midoirya asked, mildly alarmed but managing to keep it under wraps. 
"To fight?" the man frowned back. "Aren't you going out to fight?"
"Yes?" Midoriya confirmed, still confused about why this was happening. After a second, his eyes widened when he understood. "Oh, do you mean [Arena]?" he asked. He shook his head. "I don't take anyone with me."
"...But you're going to fight."
Sero took a step in front of Midoriya, ready to use his body as a physical shield out of instinctual precaution. 
"I'm fighting other mages," Midoriya clarified, "For glory, prestige, and money. None of these are things I need you guys to obliberate the enemies."
Shigaraki's eyebrows furrowed, "But you're going to fight."
Midoriya sighed, was that what Shigaraki was stuck on?
"No, I'm going to lose. Fast and efficienly so that I can come back and finish leveling yours skills."
"So you're just going to go?"
Normally, that would have been enough, and Shigaraki would have dropped it then and there. It was surprising for Midoriya to hear that he wasn't going to back down after hearing that. 
"When are you coming back?"
It almost sounded like Shigaraki didn't want him to go, which couldn't be real. 
"...Tomorrow afternoon, if all goes well."
"And if it doesn't? Won't you need me to fight then?"
"...Are you worried about me?" Midoriya couldn't help but ask. 
Sero grimaced while Shigaraki scowled. He bared his teeth at him, face flushing bright red.
"Why would I be worried about you?" he sneered out, before he disappeared with a faintest trail of mana left behind.
Well, that's what worked, Midoriya figured. He sighed, stepping up to the teleporter.
"I'll be going then," he told Sero. He gave a wave as the taller man waved back.
"Yeah... I... I can't tell if you know how to use us really well or if you're really oblivious. You know this is going to bite you in the ass if you leave it unchecked, right?"
Midoriya shrugged back. 
"I have enough to deal with today. I'll deal with it tomorrow." 
The teleporter hummed as his magic channeled through it. He gave a hum as it started up. Maybe he should use it more often, it would help make the whole process go by faster. Right when he was about to enter through the gate, he took a deep breath.
"Well, I'm off."
And, in a move that was completely unlike Sero, the young man grabbed his summoner's hand. Yanking Midoriya forward, he pressed their lips together in a quick kiss. Midoriya gave a quiet sound of shock, and Sero gave him a wide grin.
"I'll be waiting," he said, pushing his summoner through the gate.
Standing on the other side of the gate, watching it close up, Midoriya lifted his fingers to his lips. 

-

"Stain, do you want some?"
"...I'm a Summon. I don't require substance."
Midoriya looked up to the starry skies, "Yeah, I guess you're right." He gave a quiet sigh, "Could you stay with me?"
"If it's an order."
"Ha," a humorless escaped between pale lips, "I guess you're right. Do as you please then."
Midoriya closed his eyes, and took another deep breath. He jerked out of his concentration when he heard something be poured. He turned, wide-eyed as he watched Stain pour more tea into his cup.
"You shouldn't invite someone for tea if you only have one cup," he said.
Midoriya lifted his hand up, and in the comfort of his Citadel, created a small teacup out of magic. He placed it down next to his, a smile on his face. Without another word, Stain poured himself a cup as he settled down on the otherside of the teatray.
"I thought you didn't need to eat," Midoriya said playfully. 
"I don't. I don't mind the occational sweet though."
The young man, grateful for the change of topic, for Midoriya to focus on something other than that awful mission that happened today, hummed. "What kind of sweets?" He took a daifuku and ate it. Chewing while he watied for a response, his eyes gazed back to the stars twinkling above. By the time he swallowed and took some tea to help wash it down, he figured that they weren't going to have a conversation after all.
"...Izuku," he was about to turn his head, when Stain suddenly appeared in front of him. His breath caught in his throat, as Stain's lips met his. A tongue slid in, coaxing his and sucking sloppily on it. A high-pitch noise escaped Midoriya as he placed his hands on Stain's shoulder.
The taller man leaned back, his breathing undisturbed as he licked his lips.
"It's been a while, but it's as sweet as I remember."
Midoriya's face flushed.
"Y-You-"
With a rich chuckle, Stain turned on his heel.
"G'night, Summoner."
And he was gone.
At the very least, Midoriya was safe from nightmares for the night.

-

Midoriya cursed long and hard in his head. While he figured that the boss monster of the dungeon would be in the final room, he didn't think that there would be sub-bosses hidden in the corridors. To think that, just by opening the door, it would trigger a battle.
The ceiling caved in, and a minotaur dropped down. The rush of air, coupled with the sudden drop, made Midoriya unsteady on his feet. 
To his shock, however, arms wrapped around him and someone's body came to shelter him from the shockwave. He wasn't too shocked and surprised when the minotaur popped in, but his entire thought process disengaged when he felt Dabi's embrace. He had pushed Midoriya to the side, protecting him from debris, dust and the Minotaur's preumptive strike.
"D-Dabi?"
Blue eyes flitted to his face before he looked back forward.
"Focus."
"Y-Yes!"
He would have to think about it later. First, he had to worry about the battle. He squished down the butterflies in his heart as he focused his mana to their contract. Even if Dabi acted purely out of self-interest, it didn't change the fact that Dabi acted at all. Dabi had, for one reason or another, jumped to help him, rushed to pull him out of harm's way when he's never done it before.
And worst of all, he did it in such a cool and smooth way that Midoriya felt his heart skip a beat.
"


### Chronical

>> By the time Midoriya Izuku was born, the world had ended. 25 and alone, he wakes up in a beautiful world of quirks, heroes and villains, convined that the world is going to end.

"You... what?"
Midoriya stared at Aizawa fondly. The same way someone would stay at a nostalgic memory.
"There's someone I want to save," he replied back.
"So you destoyed four cities? You crippled hero society? Ruined infractucture and impaired the economy? Because you wanted to save someone?"
The man blinked back, a sheepish smile coming onto his face. 
"When you say it like that, I guess it sounds like I'm the bad guy."
Aizawa took a deep breath and pinched the bridge of his nose.

-

"But the biggest concern is still All Might," Spinner said. "His response time is insane."
Midoriya shook his head, "As long as we have Twice, this won't fail," he said. "N omatter how good his response time is, he still can't be everywhere at once."
Twice straightened under the words, but green eyes remained focus on the screen.
"...All Might..." Midoriya murmured as he watched the footage. "Yeah, you don't have to worry about him."
The others looked at him in no little amount of distrust. Midoriya wondered if it was that surprising. It must have been, since they looked at him like he was an overconfident, cocky asshole.
"Are you sure?" Shigaraki asked. "That's All Might, you know."
Midoriya shrugged back. Judging by the scale of activity, we'll be going up against him anyways. If he's as strong as everyone says, then we're going to get wiped out before we do anything meaningful anyways. But he's if he's not, then why should I play to the tune of someone weaker than me?"
They stared at him. 
The world trembled and mourned when a villain as strong as All Might took center stage.

-

Midoriya stared at Endeavor for a long moment. And in that second, Endeavor made probably the biggest blunder of his entire career.
He saw Midoriya's face.
Midoriya, in that moment, did not look like a villain who wished to tear down society. He did not look like a lunatic who wanted revenge or a psychopath who wanted to watch people suffer. Actually, if Enji had to put a word to it, he looked at Endeavor the same way children did.
Eyes wide with wonder and awe, the flush of excitement in their small hands and chubby cheeks, Midoriya looked like he was a child at a Hero Festival. Not in a strange, manic way, like the villains who chased his fire to be burned, but the quiet kind of way. 
He looked peaceful, before his eyes met Endeavor and he dipped his head forward. Respect. On any other person, it would have been respect, but this was a villain. A villain who made society tremble and forced All Might into a corner.
"...Endeavor-san," he told him, eyes gentle, "You will become Number One Hero. I think you can do it."
Endeavor, who had to come in as All Might's backup, who came in as backup at the broadcasted fight where All Might was pushed into retirement, became Number One Hero in the most unsatisfying way possible. 

### Pansy

Alone, Shennong thought, he was okay being alone. He thought and believed it, until that hand slid into his, and with a wide grin on her face, tugged him along to view the starry skies from the flower field. He should have been okay, being alone.
Wrapping an arm around her, his human, he rubbed his face alongside her. She giggled, a bright sound that he could encase in his heart so he would be reminded of a time when he wasn't alone.
