The problem with getting hurt was that it made it easier to get hurt. Which was funny and sounded totally obvious. But Deku wasn't very bright.
For people like him, who only had hard work (and even then, that wasn't much)

### way back home

"... I'm not much of a cook," Midoriya said, "but I think you have enough materials for curry."
"M... Materials?" Daiboro repeated and Toyomitsu turned around very slowly.
"You mean like... edible things, right?" the blond asked, as though suddenly concerned and scared for his life.
"Eh?" Midoriya blinked twice and flushed darkly, "Y-Yes," he said. Frantically waving his hands in front of him, he flustered, "O-Of coure, I meant real ingrediants! Please don't look at me like that!"


-

"... Sounds like we have enough materials for curry," Daiboro said, a wide grin on his face.
Midoriya covered his face and groaned. "Please forget that ever happened."
And a big frown creased Dabi's face, and his eyebrows furrowed, the way it always did when he learned something about Midoriya from someone else. Stain nudged him with his knee, giving him a knowing look before he stood in front of him.


### apoc

>> all those who have been bit get a power-up

The sudden barrage of ice had them reeling back. Standing at the center of the ice, looking as surprised as anyone else, Toyua looked from his legs to the ice. 
"...I can use it," he whispered out. 
Something on the otherside of the ice screeched, and Touya clutched Deku closer to his chest. Nope. Compeltely unresponsive. If Touya couldn't feel his labored breathing against his neck, he wouldn't have thought he was carrying around a dead body.
But Deku wasn't dead. He was very close to it, but he wasn't dead. He was breathing. He was warm. He had a heartbeat.
And that was enough for Dabi.
His teeth chattered as the ebbing cold from his legs made it harder to move them, but his arms were warm-not enough to burn since he was holding someone precious- and the conflicting temperatures was making his head spin.
"Whoa-"
And who would have thought that there would be a day where he was honestly glad he had real back-up.
"-damn, Dabi," Twice whistled. "I knew you had it in you! // Hand over Deku!"
And he scoffed, because the worst part about not being able to figh was relying on someone else. Though he supposed that there were worst people to wait for.
"Yeah, yeah," he replied back.

-

"...So, fire out your arms and ice out your legs, huh?" Mr Compress whistled. 
The irony of the situation didn't leave Dabi. Leaning his elbows on his knees, he watched as Deku diligently plant seeds in the flower garden. 
"...Yeah," he said.
No matter how much it bothered him, no matter how annoyed he felt with this bundle of emotions squeezing his chest, his eyes looked forward to watch the careful way Deku watered each and every single plant. 
He got up.
"Take care of guard duty," he said. 
Compress placed a hand over his heart and gave a bow, "But of course."
Yeah, Dabi wasn't really worried about this guy. He looked back over at Deku and sighed. 
He'd be back.
"Deku, I'm going to go train. Don't give Mister a hard time."
Deku, as though he didn't even speak, didn't even raise his head. Dabi sighed. This guy was the first to react if the wind blew too hard on the windows. He was pretty certain that he was heard, but the young man didn't answer. It didn't bother him as much as it used to, but it still made his chest feel too small.
If he could use this in a fight, if he had perfect control over this temperature, would Deku notice when he was gone?
To his surprise, Deku stood up.
"May I come too?"
Dabi and Compress stared in shock as the young man walked over, his watering can in his hand and the rest of the seeds in the bag in his other hand. 
Dabi's knee-jerk reaction was to say yes, because there was never a reason to deny this man anything. 
But his eyes fell to the bandage around his neck, and shook his head.
"I'm not about to give Nat-kun another reason to come and talk to me," he said, "

-

"But it was my husband!" she cried out, "So I should have dibs on what he found!"
And while Dabi would never choose Kenji to be on his crew, he didn't think that he would have such soddy taste in people. Well, he supposed that you wouldn't know how a person would react until it happened. 
Deku stepped forward, and handed her a bag. "This is what he pulled off of him."
Aizawa's ashen face slowly looked up at Deku. The woman stared and then snatched the bag out of his hand. Spinner took a step forward, ready to take her hands off for being so rude, but Deku raised his hand in front of him. 
"There-There's nothing in here!" she yelled out, "There has to be something. He had to have found something! He left, with water and food so why did he only have this coming back? Where's the medicine!? What about my pain medication!?"
Under the helmet, no one could see the expression Deku was making. Was he angry? Was he upset? Was he disappointed? 
"This is what he had," he said.
"That's a lie!" she cried out, "There has to be more! You took it, didn't you? You-"
Aizawa stepped in between them. If he hadn't, the woman would have died. It was just a matter of if Chimera could fire faster than Dabi could burn (or maybe Stain was back and her head would slide off and she wouldn't even notice. It's happened enough times for Dabi to know that it wasn't impossible).
"You need to calm down before you lose your life," he said. "Deku, we'll deal with this. Go ahead in."
"...It's fine," Deku said, "We all lost someone."
His hands, with three of his fingers a swelling purple, came up to pull the helmet off of his head. Pale-faced with bags so dark he looked like he had been punched, Deku spoke quietly. 
"This is something we will work on, to decide how we are going to make this choice. This will be the last time we hand out someone's remains like this."
After all, the people who worked and cared for those who went out on these runs were the people that went with them the most.

"Being with you," Dabi said quietly, "is painful."
Next to him, blissfully unaware, was Midoriya. Sleeping without a care in the world, and Dabi didn't even blame him. Even if Dabi was to unleash his ultimate attack, he would have to unleash it twice before Midoriya's health dipped into the red. 
Not that Dabi would ever do it. He liked his human where he was, by his side (or on top of him or underneath him, he wasn't that picky). 
But if he admitted to Midoriya, the young man would find a way (and Dabi just knew he would succeed, because his human was good at all he did) and this [Reverse Scale], the only thing that Dabi could say was his, would be gone.
And somehow, he felt like a life filled with pain was so much more bearable than a life devoid of everything.
He placed his arm around Midoriya's waist, curling around him and pressed his nose against his curls. 
Midoriya made this quiet sound, and Dabi watched as his lips curled into a smile.
"Dabi..." he mumbled quietly, "...Let's catch and eat that fish..."
The dragon gave a quiet hum, and even though he never learned how to do it, he started to look forward to tomorrow. 

### sat

There were a lot of things that there the "proper" way to do things. Not because these were the arbitrary and dumb things that society added (and boy, did they add a bunch) but also because there were things that triggered something instinctually. 
For example, Izuku could not just accept things from someone. It was something that could potentially get someone maimed. Carelessly accepting a towel from Kaminari would get the young man beaten an inch into his life. At the same time, when Kirishima bore the brunt of the beating and came out swinging, Chisaki had ultimately accepted him, whatever that meant.
But now Kirishima, with a black eye and a missing front tooth, was allowed to stand next to him with minimal other alphas snarling and hissing at him. Which. 
It gave him a headache, as all things that pertain to alphas do. 
Shigaraki explained it once.
"I'm not about to let some bitch cut in front of me to get to you," he said. "We're waiting on what you want to do. We're trying to prove our worth to you. But some little bitch waltz in and tries to make a claim on you-" and Shigaraki bared his teeth, eyes turning to slits, "-and that makes the whatever between us into nothing, because you think we're all the same."
Izuku, who figured he was being sweet-talked (to the best of Shigaraki's very limited ability), just heard it as "there's one more thing you need to be aware of, as an omega."
And instead of alphas learning and understanding that handing something to Izuku didn't mean anything special, the same way they handed towels and waters out to each others after a hard day of work didn't mean anything special. 
"Treat us more specially," Snipe replied, "then we'll stop preceiving all the little things you do and don't do so bodly." 
Izuku lifted his hand up to take the report, and the invident fresh in his mind, scooted back from the desk. "On the table," he said.
Snipe stared back, and pulled at his shirt, "Right now?"
"N-No," Izuku's face flushed, "T-The report! I meant the report!"
Snipe laughed, a rich sound that made Izuku feel like he was being played with instead of rejecting someone. "Yes, yes," he said, placing the report on the table. 

-

"F-for you."
Izuku stared at the chocolate bar being handed to him. 
In less than a second, Aizawa, who he respected as someone who was so in-control over his instincts, came surging forward. A ferocious snarl ripped from the taller man. Delivering a painful looking kick to the temple of the alpha in front of him, Izuku stared with wide eyes. His hand, on his bat, loosened a bit as he blinked.
He turned to the side, where Yagi's frown met him.
"Don't worry about him, Izuku-shounen," Yagi said, "We'll handle this."
And Izuku, deciding that he had dealt with enough alpha-stints to last him three lifetimes, nodded. 
"Don't kill him," he called out.
And Aizawa's head snapped up, their eyes met for a brief moment, and Izuku felt his heart seize up at the wounded sound that came from him.
And then Hawks came down next to him.
"You care?" he asked, sounding so hurt, and Izuku understood that this was something beyond logic andthus, he needed to cease and desist immediately.
Quickly, he left the scene instead. It was just better. He could only hope that some part of that alpha that tried to give him chocolate would at least come out alive.

"You won't get better equipment," Hawks said.
"...But?" Tokoyami replied.
The blond rubbed the back of his head, probably trying to find the right words to say, when Miruko came (uninvited, Hawks would like to mention) into the conversation.
"Their customer service is absolute ass," she said, and gave this wide grin, "And Hawks here got into a fist-fight with their receptionist a few times."
Which, by the way, was some fucking bullshit. Dabi totally had it coming.

### kind nightmare

"Kan-sensei," Nezu said, "He's not your student."
"...I ran into him last night," Kan replied. "...He looked like he was having a hard time. To look at someone who's having a hard time and say that 'well, he's not my direct responsibility' isn't the kind of hero I want to be. Nor is it the kind of teacher that should be teaching the next generation of heroes." He leaned back in his seat, thinking about the way Midoriya's trembling smile told him that he was okay. "I trust Aizawa, but I want to see it for myself. I want to see this through."
"I think that's an admirable quality," Nezu agreed, beaming. "I'll approve it, so long as you don't neglect your responsibility."
Kan nodded.
"And I think that Midoriya-kun could use the support. It looks like he trusts you, Kan-sensei. Please don't betray it."
Kan felt a knife plunge into his heart and twist. 
"I... Yes sir."
Proper amendments and reparations. He understood the she-bang.

- 

Midoriya stood in front of the closet. This time would be different. This time would be something else. He set his clock 


-

Midoriya stared at his number on his chest and felt his bottom lip start to tremble. The number on is chest, that finally reached 30 after he raped and desecrated his teachers' dignity, had plummented down to 5. 
But.
Dabi's arm came around his waist and pulled him down. With Dabi's lips against the nape of his neck, the man spoke quietly. 
"You know, those were always itchy," he said quietly. "Fucking, being in the sun hurt, being under a heater, made everything annoying."
His skin, now smooth and unblemished from any scar or cut (except for the angry nail marks on his back that Midoriya left behind) that had before, seemed to glisten under the filtered starlight from the open window. 
"It's not that bad."

-

To Dabi, it sorta felt like there was nothing left. That, everything that he was Dabi for, everything that he stood for, was something that a kid could fuck out of him. And suddenly, he was left feeling that much more hollow.
It was, he thought, pathetically easy to erase everything that had happened to him. It was, shockingly, an incredible fast and simple process to be saved. He just needed to meet the right person.
The thought swole up inside of him, seeping in despite his best efforts to forget and not think about it.
How different would life had been, if he had someone like Midoriya in his life? Pressing his face to Midoriya's curls, he already had an answer. He just didn't want to explain it yet.

-

A knot of fear tied his stomach and sat heavy in his gut as he opened the door and Dabi stood there. Bright blue eyes and a duffel bag slung over his shoulder, he leaned against the doorframe and looked down at the younger man.
"You gonna let me in?"
"R-right," and because Midoriya needed to level up and no other reason, he took a step back. Give and gain, or whatever. "D-Do you want some..." his voice trailed off when Dabi came in and he closed the door beind him, and realized that his sleeve was dripping with blood. "I-I'll get a first-aid-"
His back was pushed against the wall and Dabi's lips were on his. He licked, languid and slow, like they had all the time in the world but all Midoriya could think about was how hard it was to get blood off his shoes.
"W-Wait, Dabi-"
"It's fine," he said, leaning back. "I'll make sure you get back the levels I take from you."
And that wasn't the problem. Dabi scuffed his shoes off and turned back to him.
"Here."
He tossed the bag at Midoriya's chest, and if Midoriya didn't work out with All Might everyday, he might have felt 

"You need cash, don't you?"
