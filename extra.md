"...You don't look like a mutant," he said, "so why are you here?"
Kan stared at him and then back to the fire. He pointed to where Inui was getting his tal brushed by Midoriya.
"He's my friend," Kan said, "Been together for a long as I can remember." He stared at the pair for a moment longer and then smiled, "People say that mutants are monsters waiting to happen, but for me, he's still Inui. and that's never changed."
Spinner looked at his hands.

The small human made a vague motion to the sad-looking hunk of metal on wheel in front of them. 
"This is our home-"
And Gang Orca's hands grabbed Midoriya's shoulders, and Chimera's narrowed at his hands on Midoriya with no small amount of disapproval. 
"Midoriya," Sakamata said, "There are eight of us. Seven of us are over six feet. We cannot live in this RV like this anymore if you plan on adding more people like this."
The young man stared back and then looked around, "B-but isn't it like a sleepover?"
"I don't mind sharing a cot with you," Chimera said, licking his teeth, and Midoriya brightened. 
"A sleepover!" he repeated and Sakamata shook his head.
"W-What if we camp?" on the other side of him, Kan spoke up. "Outdoor campting is a lot of fun, too, Midoriya. Have you ever tried it?"

-

And Midoriya spoke so certainly.
"Then come with me," he said, extending his hand out towards him. "I'm looking for friends to come with me."
"I... A-Are you sure you want me?"
The smile didn't dim, and the hand didn't reced away. Eyes as gentle as the morning sun, Chimera realized that a world bathed in this light was something that was availiable for him too.
"I... I'm a bad person. Did a lot of bad things."
Midoriya, who was naive as he was stupid, laughed back.
"I'm Quirkless," he replied back, "So I guess we found the right people, huh?"
Chimera remembered the Witch Hunt. He remembered, and he took several of those targets and cashed them in himself. It was the easiest money he had ever met. 

-

"There's someone that I want to kill," Dabi said.
"You're a terrible liar," Midoriya replied, "so next time, just sa that you don't want to tell me."
The older man blinked at him, too shocked to domuch else.
Midoriya smiled back, like there was nothing wrong in the world.

-

"What about a train?"
"Then we'd have to worry about railroads," Chimera added. "Not sure what kind of railroads we could find here."
"Let's fly."
There was a long pause, and they all turned to Midoriya.
The oun man looked up towards the sky.
"Doesn't that sound like freedom? The island floating in the sky. We don't have to worry about camping or being attacked in the middle of the night-"
"Flying?!"
"Li-like just having some island floating around in the sky?"
"Laputa?!"
The chorus of sound that came out made Midoriya jerk. He blinked at them, and then nodded.
"Just a few spells, and it should be fine," he said, "We have mana stones, so as long as the mana keeps filling the spell in, it should work fine."
In the face of logic and physics and everything, Midoriya Izuku had a small island floating in the sky by lunch.

-

"We can take you to the nearest safe zone," Midoriya explained, "but if you come with us, you have to work. The work isn't easy."
But what were they going to say? No thanks, we don't want to work and we would rather just lay on our sides and die instead?
"We... We'll come," Aizawa said. "I'll work enough for them, so just...." he looked at Midnight, and amended his words, "I'll do whatever you want, so them. PLease save them."
"...You said anything," Midoriya said, "Don't go back on your word, okay?"
Aizawa's gut twisted.

-

"Did you relaly promise them anything?" Yamada asked quietly. He looked to his friend, touched and worried unlike anything else. "Shota..."
"Yeah," Aizawa replied, staring blankly forward. "...Glad you're okay."
The door pushed open, and an unruly mess of green hair poked into the room.

"You said anything," Midoriya said, three boxes of board games in his arms, "So you mean that you wanna play "chutes and ladders," right?" His bottom lip pushed out a little more, and Aizawa blinked slowly. 
"He said Uno, didn't he?!" Twice asked, barely a step behind Midoriya. "Let's play uno!"
Aizawa and Yamada took a look at the boxes of board games, none of which were "chutes and ladders" or "Uno" and then back at each other.
"Sure," Aizawa said, because he agreed to anything. Mnaybe, it was okay to hope, and maybe, it wasn't going to be some death match or aything. Hope was a strange thing.

### kind nightmare

"I... I feel as though you have been seeing Aizawa-kun and Kan-kun more often now," Yagi said quietly, "And the times where we shared lunch has reduced."
Midoriya blinked, and felt his face start to heat. No, don't do that, he tried his hardest to fight it while coming up with a good excuse.
"I-I-I..." Nope, nothing. He had no excuse. He didn't even know how to explain this to All Might. "I'm sorry."
Was... Was his mentor disappointed? He could only imagine, but he swore that he wasn't slacking off in training. As awful that closet-portal was, in exchange for the blood on his hands he had some more fighting experience.
"Ah, I'm not trying to accuse you of anything," Yagi said quickly, waving his hand in front of him, "I was just worried that there was something wrong."
Midoriya, who never knew how much he relied on someone's "Welcome Home," bit down on the inside of his cheek. 
"I'm alright," he said, and gave a wide grin. All Might was a busy person, even if he was preparing to retire. It wouldn't do to burden him with needless drama. "I won't let it interfere with my work."
He reached into his backpack.
"Actually, All Might-san, concerning the training..." And the questions that heh ad before came spilling out and for this lunch session, Midoriya felt like everything was alright.

-

"I just wanted you to know," Yagi said, opening and closing his hand into a fist before letting resting them on his knees. "I am on your side. Even if you think that it's a minor thing, if it's important enough to you that you're thinking about it, then it's also important to me."
Midoriya felt his heart swell. 
As expected of Number One Hero. Just his words were enough for Midoriya to pull his shoulders back and the previous self-pity and dreary feelings he had was wiped away.
Midoriya could do it. All Might, the Symbol of Peace, saw something worthwhile in Midoriya. Midoriya wanted to meet that expectation. Midoriya wanted to do him proud, and make it so thta no one would ever be able to say that he was just some mistake. 
"Yes!" he said, eyes bright and grin wide. "I'll do my best!"
What All Might gave him wasn't a quirk, but hope. 
That night, Midoriya stood in front of the closet and made his decision.
[and meets shigaraki that night ]

-

[Collect Artifact 0/1]
"W-What the hell?"

And from this, Midoriya learned that he could leave someone in that closet. 
His chest heaving, his sides aching and stomach churning, Midoriya didn't even register that he had made it back until he felt the sun's rays.
Shit.
He shot up. 
School.


### 104 kan/midoriya promise to be true

"Yeah, Sensei said he'd give me a ride home," Midoriya said.
Kan's face stretched into a frown. "Don't worry, Izuku. I'll come and pick you up."
