# kind nightmare

Jin grabbed Midoriya's hand.
"Hey," he said.
Midoriya peered up at him, curious as he held his dishes in his hand. 
"Do you... Do you prefer honest guys or-or righteous ones? Is... Is it better that I'm not a liar or is it better to do the right thing?"
Because he owed it to Giran. If he owed anything to anyone, it would be Giran. That's why, he needed to have an answer. Twice or Jin? For the person that finally made the world quiet, he felt like he owed this to him. For a future together, it was only right to ask. 
Twice or Jin?
What did Midoriya want?
"I want to tell you to do the right thing," Midoriya said, "but sometimes, what the [right thing] to do isn't clear. That's why, I think it's fine, to do what you want to do, Jin."
"What... I want?"
Midoriya smiled back, a tinge of sadness that had Jin twitching for a gun, and he spoke quietly. "If you come back, I'll forgive you."
Was it possible? The question from before came circling back. Was it really possible to fall more in love with someone? Before he knew what he was doing, he hard his arms around Midoriya, holding him close to his heart and relishing in the quiet gasp he gave. Midoriya's heartbeat picked up, two times bigger than anything that Jin could imagine fitting in that small body of his.
"I will," he said. "I will come back to you."
He stopped there, because anything more would sound too final. He stopped there, and they would pick up from this moment when he returned. 
And when he returned, he'd make sure that Midoriya would never fear being alone again.

"Hey, Hero-san," Twice said, "you uh... You protect people right Their, their stupidly peaceful life?"
"Something like that."
Twice looked up at Hawks, and then back to his feet. It really grated his nerves to do this, like this, but the thought of Midoriya's smiling face had him facing the hero. Shoulders pulled back, he looked right at him.
"There's someone I want to protect," he said, "He means more than anything else to me. He's a good guy. Better than me. Better than I deserve."
Hawks didn't reply.
"I don't really care about me, but him. Can you just. Keep an eye on him or something?"
It was a dangerous move. Twice was doing a lot more than leaving his heart on the line. But Hawks was a hero, and Twice wanted to believe in the heroes that Midoriya wanted to be.
Midoriya was someone that made Twice want to learn how to cook, you see. It was important because old dogs don't learn new tricks, but Twice was so good at making katsudon that Midoriya cried when he ate it (and scraped the bowl clean). So Twice, even Twice, could learn how to believe in a hero again, right?
"I'll do what you want. Selling out those guys, giving you all the information for their weapons and where we're getting trigger. I can do all that."
With the way his head was before, it would have been impossible, but Twice knew about a kid who made the impossible possible, a kid that was waiting for someone to fill that apartment made for two. 
"I'll see what I can do," Hawks said. It wasn't a yes, it wasn't a no, and it was everything that Twice hated about heroes. They couldn't ever just say it and mean it. 
But Twice was a desperate man, who finally found someone to go back to.
"His name is Midoriya Izuku. Won't find anyone cuter than him."
He didn't know how to explain the expression on Hawks' face as anything other than the fact that he didn't like it.

Hawks sat, perched on the windowsill as his feathers slipped in and unlocked it from the inside. When they get Inko out and he receives her blessings, he would move her to a place

>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.
