# The Final Exam

- no hero; all quirks 
- kids who can't control their quirk are sent to this school. if they can't control it/aren't controllable by graduation, people like Midoriya are hired to dispatch and kill them
- ua is an island
- rody was izuku's former getaway driver, taking a break from all that shit to make time to hang out with his family and see the world
- misoro siblings were izuku's first-aid ppl/safe-house 

- U-A folk who are teachers: Bakugo (literature), Sero (history), Kirishima (PE), Uraraka (biology), Iida (chemisty), Midoriya (math?) -???

-older!eri - school nurse and is not above beating kids and turning their time back (also head over heels for Midoriya)

- Principal = Nezu, who used personal money to make the world a better place, but it's easier if everyone thinks you're just another capitalistic pig. Truly and genuinely grateful for midoriya for not abandoning these kids and finding someone who cares as much as he does

When Midoriya, a casual hitman, came home and saw that his entire apartment complex gone, he had no idea what he was going to do. Where would he go? Where could he live?
At that moment in time, he met a rat. Training kept his hand on the gun in his jacket, and his features into a small smile. 
"Oh my!" he said, "It's our school's most generous donator!"
And Midoriya, in all his years hunting and killing, hand't been snuck up.
"Pardon?"
"Yes, who else delivered such a wonderful and continuous monthly payment to our wonderful establishment, Midoriya Izuku-san?"
At some point, Midoriya had gotten lazy. He wasn't paying attention. He should have just bought the entire complex as soon as he had the money, because now, the only link he had to his mother was gone. He looked to where his apartment used to be, just an empty plot of land, and then back to the man. 
"If you have the time, I would absolutely love the chance to talk to you."
And Midoriya, tired of the blood on his hands, exhausted from traveling, and a little bit lost concerning where to go from here, agreed. 
Which was how he ended up as the live-in teacher of UA High school, a school for special students. Or as Midoriya understood it, kids who no one wanted to deal with.
He sighed.

"Wait, Shigaraki!" Midoriya called out, standing up.
There was a tense silence, and they stared with bated breath. Was this it? Were they finally going to fight? Was this new Midoriya-sensei finally going to show his true colors and prove to all of them that he was the same as any other person that they had met?
"Don't forget your bento!" he said, lifting the wrapped package in his hand. "Here!"
"I... What?"
Shigaraki stared at him, the way he came closer to hand it off to him, and gave him a smile.
"You signed up for the bento-program, actually. I didn't realize it until yesterday, so sorry about that. You're right. I have a lot to work on, so thank you for that reminder."
He gave a wide grin.
"Have a good day today, okay?"
Shigaraki stared at him, and in his surprise, just took the bento. Midoriya waved him goodbye and turned around to the rest of the occupants in the room. 
"Don't forget to take your bento! Your names are written on them. Purple for our third-years, red for our second-years, and green for our first-years."
Mornings in the dorms have recently gotten louder.

"I don't mind it," Miruko said, taking another giant biteful of the curry. She chewed for a few moments, and with her mouth still food explained, "I never had homemade food before," she explained.
She swallowed.
"It taste like shit," she explained, "convenience store food is a lot better."
"Then why are you still eating it?"
"Have you seen his fingers?" she asked, and then gave a grin.
The bowl in front of her was empty.
"I don't hate someone who works that hard to do anything."

"These are all the things we collected in your room," Nezu said. "Everything was preserved to the best of our ability."
Midoriya stared at the key being handed to him. He took it gingerly, and stared at it. It was a key to a storage unit.
He didn't want to thank him, because it wasn't his to begin with, and really, Midoriya should have gotten this first.
But at some point in his life, he was ashamed. Too ashamed to show his face to the place where he grew up and once naively told his mom that he wanted to be a hero. He took the key.
It didn't feel as heavy as he thought it would.
"...This was mine to begin with," he said, "So I won't say thank you."
"Natrually."
"But... Thank you," Midoriya said, standing up and bowing politely, "For dinner that night."
Nezu smiled back, and waved.
"I just did what anyone would have done."
And Midoriya had heard worse lies. 

# kind nightmare

"Never thought I'd hear a confession," Jin said, coming out of the room he was hiding in. Somewhere, he knew that he could have just shown his face, shown what a waste of space that man was, going after a kid half his age, weight, and height, but something kept him anchored to the room. "Man, that's your teacher, right? He's.."
His voice trailed off, catching the way Midoriya stared at the door, flowers in his grip.
Come on they were red roses, too. How cliche'd could he get? Even Jin... Actually, Jin just brought some food. And a box of condoms. But stil, wasn't Vlad King a hero? Didn't he have a real income? Who just shows up and confesses their feelings in the middle of the night, doesn't demand sex or an answer and leave?
Real people, apparently.
People that had Midoriya staring at the door, people that made Midoriya cradle the flowers carefully against his chest, people that Jin coudn't be.
"What an old-fashioned dude," he said, "Is this even allowed? Does UA allow just any pedophile to become a teacher?"
That caught Midoriya's attention, as his head snapped to Jin and spoke quietly, "He's not like that."
Jin felt his heart twist. 
"Then what is it?" he asked, "Some old man comes by in the middle of the night to see a little kid. If that isn't a criminal then-"
"The criminal here is me!"
Jin's jaw clicked shut, and Midoriya's voice echoed in the entranceway. 
"It's not... It's not sensei's fault that he met me," he said, staring at the roses, his expression scrunching.
And Jin hated it. He hated seeing that expression on Midoriya's face. Hated seeing it because Midoriya was the one person in his life that didn't look like that, didn't look like there were no heroes or anything, and Jin rushed forward.
"But you-" he hesitated, "You're not a bad person. You're, you're my hero."
The light that returned in Midoriya's eyes was brief, but instead of returning that radiance to him, his shoulders curled in more. 
"I don't know," Midoriya said quietly, "I... I don't think that I'm much of a hero at all," he explained. "Because Sensei... I tricked sensei." He looked at the roses.
"You tricked him?"
"Jin, the truth is, like that knife, I've been getting other items fom the dungeon," he explained slowly, "and using those items... to Sensei, I-"
And somehow, that brought relief to Jin.
"So it's not real," he said.
Midoriya's head snapped up, eyes wide. "What?"
"His feelings," and Jin felt both smart and clever for figuring it out so fast, "aren't real. It was the working of the dungeon."
"I..." Midoriya's voice trailed, his eyes staring at the ground, and Jin could see the gears in his head turning.
"So all we gotta do is clear the dungeon, and you get your mom back, and all of this," he made a motion at the offending bouquet of shitty roses in Midoriya's arms, "goes away, right?"
"...Right," Midoriya whispered back, his eyes looked back to the door, the roses against his chest and Jin couldn't help but feel like there was something out of his reach. Like he was holding onto something that was slipping out. It was a terrible feeling, but he didn't know how to reaffirm his grip.
"C'mon," Jin said, grabbing Midoriya's shoulders, but Midoriya's eyes wouldn't pull away from the door. His heart pounded against his breastbone, and his mind searched desperately for an answer. What did he have to do to keep those green eyes on him? What did he have to do, so that Sensei wouldn't be what he thinks about, staring at the door when Jin was here, real and whole-
He kissed Midoriya. Their teeth clanged in his rush, but he didn't stop there. His hands came to grab Midoriya's hips and the young man pulled back with a hiss.
He paused for a second, that sinking feeling threatening to swallow him, and he thought about it. Come to think about it, when he first met Midoriya (and that was a memory he touched himself to often), there were marks then too. He grabbed Midoriya's shirt and yanked it up, showing his chest (and his incredibly tasty-looking nipples) and he stared at the marks on him. Some were old and fading and some were new and looked raw.
"Hah!" he barked out a laugh, knowing that he would cry if he wasn't careful. 
Come to think of it, on that day, why was Midoriya even out?
He kissed him, hopeful that it would make a difference. That Twice could make a difference. He kissed him, tilting his head and forcing Midoriya's head back. He pushed his tongue in, determined to claim everything inside for himself. He pulled back with a gasp and leaned down to latch on to the space right where Midoriya's ribcage ended.
"Wha-Jin?"
He bit down hard, until he could taste iron and Midoriya flinched under his touch. He licked over the bite and moved back to kiss him. A softer kiss, as though to explain with his tongue that all he wanted was Midoriya and his soft lips. The warmth of his mouth was soothing, and the wet sounds only complimented the quiet whimpers from Midoriya. If only there was a way for him to prove that he was better than some pedophile, some teacher who abused their position. If only-
He pulled back, stared at Midoriya, the bouquet of roses in his hand, and walked out of the apartment.
Two can play at this game.

>> cat scene 

Aizawa eyed the mark on Midoriya's chest, right below the ribcage, feeling as though someone was mocking him. He had been eyeing it, every time it showed up, and some ugly feeling started to brew inside of him.
"...Aizawa-sensei?"
He turned to give his full attention back to his student. Midoriya tilted his head, shirt fully on and his homework open in front of him, and the older man gave a long sigh through his nose. 
"What?"
"Are you... okay?" he asked. 
"Midoriya," Aizawa did his best to keep his tone and features neutral, "I thought I told you to come and find me."
