>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

It was twisted and probably wrong, but Spinner was always waiting for Deku to reject him. Everyone before had, in some way, shape, or form, but Deku hadn't. And in Spinner's head, that led to the peak of his anxiety mountain, because it scared him.
At least, if Deku saw his body and felt gross or disappointed or something, then Spinner could just blame it on something that he never had and move on. It would take some time, but he could do it. It wouldn't bother him, just the same thing he had always done.
He unzipped his pants, and pushed down his boxers. He stepped out of it, and stood in front of Deku in his fully glory.
"Izuku?"
"Oh," Deku covered his mouth, looking from his dicks to his face and then back. Bing. Spinner was careful to hide the disappointment- "I-I only stretched a litte."
"Yeah, it's fine. That's what I..." he looked up. "What?"
Deku's face, lit like Christmas lights, darkened as he covered his face with his hands. He parted his fingers just enough to peek at Spinner.
"I uhm... When, when I was thinking about this, and-and about being with you I... I always imagined one so I prepared for it accordingly. I..." his face darkened, "I-I'm sorry. I-I don't think I can fit them both."
"Uh..."
Spinner felt his face flush, like a forest fire across his cheeks, and he coughed uncomfortably.
"I uhm..." He flustered, because while he always thought about it, it was vastly different to be in the moment right then and there. But that swelling anxiety, the feeling that this dreamlike romance would dissipate, same surging back out and he blurted out, "Isn't it gross?"
"Gross?"
Just hearing Deku say the word had him flinching.
"Yeah. It... It's gross."
Deku stared at him for a moment and looked down. "Oh! oh, uhm, okay," he nodded. Closing his legs, he placed them both to the side and scooted across the bed. "I can-can turn around, and-and if you can't see it, it won't be as gross, right?"
"Huh?"
"A-as expected, it-it's better if it's a girl, right? I-If you want, I can leave. I think Shigaraki has some hentai and I can get it for you-" Deku reached for his shirt, and Spinner grabbed him by the shoulders.
"I-I what? Wait, Deku, let's just- what?" He motioned at his dicks, "Aren't you grossed out by me? It's gross. Aren't I gross?"
Deku's eyebrows furrowed, "Why would you be gross?" he asked. And when his eyes trialed down to Spinner's exposed self, is face darkened. He closed his knees, but it was too late and Spinner saw that Deku was still hard.
His heart thundered.
"So you-you wanna keep going?" he asked, the words mangled by his breathless pants. "Can we? Keep going?"
Deku looked up at him, "A-are you sure?" he asked. "I'm not," he hesitated and then quietly admitted, "I'm not a girl."
Spinner leaned down to kiss him, a gentle press of their lips as he willed himself to stay calm. He wanted Deku's first time to be perfect. He wanted their first time to be perfect.
"You're Deku," Spinner said, pulling back with a wide grin. "It's perfect. You're perfect. I..."
Was it okay that he was happy? Was it okay that he had Deku? All those questions disappeared out of his mind when Deku's hands came to cup his face.
The hands of someone who loved him was cold and a little clammy. They trembled, and gripped the sheets tightly. when Spinner's hand came to grab his, their fingers interlocked immediately, and Deku's expression melted into a smile that Spinner felt seep into his heart.

"B-but if we try it, it'll help, right?" Midoriya said, "Trying has to be better than not doing anything!"
"Do you understand?" Aizawa asked, grabbing his shoulders and shaking him hard. "What you're saying, do you understand?"
"I know that it's better than doing nothing at all."
"It's not-" Yamada cut himself off with a gasp when Aizawa surged forward to kiss Midoriya.
The young man gave a muffled cry, but long fingers gripped his chin, and his other hand grabbed his shoulder. Pushing Midoriya against the wall, his tongue slipped in when he gasped. A strangled sound escaped the young man, as he trembled. His hands came to grab Aizawa's sleeves, not pushing him away, but just holding onto him for dear life.
Yamada ran over, grabbing his friend and tearing him off their Conductor, remembering a time when they were young and promised to compete on who could spoil their Conductor more, and couldn't help but think that the world was too fragile.
"Oi, Aizawa-"
"That's what it means!" Aizawa shouted.
The blond pulled him a few feet away, but no matter how much he tugged, the man wouldn't budge. Against the wall, Midoriya slid down to sit on the ground. His body trembled, and Yamada felt the burst of rage inside of his heart.
"If you want to harmonize with someone, that's what you have to do!" he shouted out, and Yamada wanted to hit him.
Of course they wouldn't be so violent. They weren't monsters. They weren't just going to take what they want and leave Midoriya a hurting mess. He opened his mouth to fix the situation, but Midoriya replied back.
"It's okay."
Yamada felt cold.
"I'll do it. I'll harmonize with you," he said, "And, and that bonus energy can save him, right?"
There was a long silence.
"Fucking christ-"
And Aizawa was out the door.
Midoriya looked around curiously.
"I... I don't get it."
"I know," Yamada said quietly. "I know."

Endeavor extended his hand out.
"Well?"
"Well?" Midoriya parroted back.
"Take my hand."
"I-I can climb down without it," he replied, a frown on his face because he didn't want to be considered weak or baggage.
"Yes, but it'll be a while before I can find another excuse to hold your hand."
Midoriya stared back, his mouth clicking shut, and took his hand. He gave a quiet squeak as the older man pulled him into his arms. For a moment, it was as though he wouldn't put him down, and he would just carry him the rest of the way, but he was released.
"Thank you," Endeavor said.
"I-I think I should be the one to say that," the young man replied, but his lips curled into an exasperated smile.
"Why should you?" the man arched an eyebrow, "I haven't done anything deserving of your gratitude."
"You have," Midoriya replied, squeezing his hand, "From spending your time with me to looking after me, thank you."
Endeavor didn't reply, but his hand didn't release him either. Hand in hand, they walked through the street, his steps slowing to match Deku's.

Midoriya reached for the handle of the car, when someone else popped it open instead. He blinked, and looked up where Overhaul looked down at him.
"Don't touch anything," he said.
Midoriya's eyes fell to his gloves, and then back up.
"It's dirty," he continued as he stepped back for the young man to come out.
Midoriya did, the gloves on his hand feeling itchy. Not that the fabric was cheap or anything, but that his hands felt twitchy, and it made him feel claustrophobic.
"...Midoriya?"
"I-I'm pretty dirty too," he said, voice quiet and uncertain.
The older man was quiet for a moment before he pulled his mask down his face. Leaning close he gave Midoriya a quick peck on the cheek. Deku gasped, and the man chuckled, his breath of it brushing right against his skin.
"Incorrect. You are my handler. Innately clean."
The thought strangled him and his hand took Chisaki's.
"You're not dirty, either. At least, nothing that... that can't be cleaned."
There was a beat of silence.
"...Your expectations of me are too high," the older whispered back. He took a step back, helping Deku out of the car.
His hand didn't release his, and from that connection, Midoriya could feel the influx of his warmth swirling inside of him. It hit a wall, and futilely crashed against it in waves, like an ocean current running along the cliff.
Deku's earnest words did not reach him.
Despite the warmth from the hand holding his, Deku felt oddly chilled.

-

"How... How come you don't call me Izuku?"
"You never told me that I could."
Midoriya stared, and Chisaki took his glove off to extend towards the younger man.
"Ready?"
"You could, the young man said, "Call me Izuku."
And in all the hours they spent together, a bright gleam entered Chisaki's eyes, making his eyes shine like gold.
"You could call me Kai."
The blush on Midoriya's face darkened, and Chisaki's mask crinkled.
"I look forward to it," he said, and pushed his hand closer to Midoriya, as though to remind him that it was out.
The young man placed his hand on his, their base skin touching, and a shiver ran through both of them. As though to ensure that the young man wouldn't escape, he interlaced their fingers, and felt his heart skip a beat when small fingers squeezed around his.
In his heart, a warmth he had never experienced, settled in and made a home there. It pushed at his chest cavity, as though demanding more room to spread out. He covered his face, a flush overtaking his features, but the thought of using his quirk to get rid of it never occurred. Fit to burst, he could hardly believe that his small Conductor felt like this.
Because obviously, this feeling was a bleed-over from Midoriya, and not at all a reflection of how he felt.
"This way," Chisaki said quietly, "I want to show you the garden."
"You have a garden here?" he asked, stars in his eyes as he looked up at Chisaki.
The older man stared back, made a mental note to get Hojo a present for all his hard work in the garden, and nodded. "This way."
Their interlaced fingers came between them, and Chisaki had never felt so hungry but so full at the same time before.

"But you know," Hawks said, a smile on his face as he regarded the woman next to him, and he looked every bit that confident hero everyone saw on billboards. "There's nothing I wouldn't do anything for him," he said, hands in his pocket as he leaned back against the wall. "I'd even bond with you."
The slap was expected, but it didn't sting. Hawks' easy smile didn't even twitch.
"You-" she cut herself out, shaking in her anger, but what could she do?
At the very least, she wasn't stupid. She wasn't so stupid that she didn't understand her place, but she wasn't smart enough to actually do something about it. And that's all that mattered to Hawks.
She needed to hate him. Then, any feelings she could have for Izuku would fade into the obscurity. The only bad things that she could come up with would bother him, and Izuku would be left alone.
Hawks tilted his head, pushing past her and leaving now that he had what he wanted. 
Any enemy that he dealt with was an enemy that Deku didn't need to face. Of that, he would make sure.

"...Endeavor," Izuku called out as he opened the door. Silence reigned in the room, several of them standing up at the presence of their leader, chairs screeching. The following silence made his next words sound even louder. "A moment."
The older man nodded his head. "Understood." He turned to the others he was playing cards with, "Excuse me," he said before leaving them behind.
Izuku stood, low-hanging  jeans on his hips and shirtless. A thick bandage was taped to his chest, right under where his heart was, and Enji wondered what kind of injury it was, and if it was much worse than the way he carried himself. 
They made their way down the hallway to the stairwell, and then up a floor. Enji, who had long since stopped hoping that Izuku would ever explain anything to him when he asked, followed without complaints. They made their way up to the broadcasting room, and Izuku opened it. He motioned the man in and then closed the door behind him. 
Enji looked around the room, unsure of what was wanted from him as the young man looked at him.
"What do you want?" he asked, like Enji was the one that called him out.

In the spring before Midoriya became a second year,
