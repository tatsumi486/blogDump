"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

A place where there was nothing but the summer blue skies. The sun and clouds were nowhere visible from where they were but the world was warm as it was bright. The grass he laid in was soft, and the breeze was gentle. 
Holding his hand was a hand twice as big, twice as warm as his. But his grip would never be stronger than his. With a wide grin, he squeezed the hand holding his. 
He swore he heard a scoff, but with the grass rustling right next to him, it was hard to tell. Far away in his mind, he thouht that this was wonderful. His body was finally relaxed, and all his problems felt so far away from him at this moment. 
It was a perfect spring day. 

-

When he woke up, there were tears running down his face. Touching them, he wondered whose tears they were supposed to be.

-

"Wait, this hand! I-I know this hand!"
And Midoriya looked up to stare from the hand to the person it was connected to, and felt his heart drop to his stomach. 
"I... I know this hand," he repeated weakly. He peered up at him, curiously. 
His eyes met his eyes, and all he could feel was that gentle spring breeze wash over him and at once, he felt calm. A big grin came onto his face, and he gave an airy laugh.
"That blue," he said, breathless and caught in awe and wonder, "is it you?"
Two and a half hours before Touya became Dabi, he found something he didn't want to burn.

-

"Touya-san-"
"Just Touya, Izu-"
"Touya-san," and the hard emphasis had the man pausing. "I'm sorry."
"For what?"
"I'm not..." he wrangled his hands in front of his chest. The fingers that connected the two of them together, 
"I... You're not upset?"
Touya looked from the papers in his hands to Midoriya and then back.
"I am."
Midoriya deflated, because that did makemore sense, but hearing confirmation like that made his heart ache. 
"But I told myself that I'd forgive you."
"Eh?"
"For as long as I remember the way your hand feels," he said, taking Midoriya's hand and kissing his knuckles like he was some prince from a fairy-tale, "I'll forgive you. No matter what you did."
"I-I ... That... That doesn't sound good. F-for you."
Blue eyes so soft it felt like the sky would come spilling out and cradle him to heaven focused on Midoriya.
"That's fine," the older man replied, leaning back in his seat. "You don't need to," he said, and slowly pulled his hand away from Midoriya's.
And Midoriya grabbed his hand. Lacing their fingers together with practiced ease as he shook his head, "But that's not fair to you."
And Touya stared at their hands, and then laughed.
"I used to think that it was just a dream. and that, only when I dreamed, I would..." he squeezed Midoriya's hand. "But you're real."
A spring green that he didn't think could exist out of fantasies sat next to him, holding his hand.
"Nothing in the world was ever given to me, but," he leaned in to kiss him, right on the apple of his cheek. He pulled back slowly, his eyelashes dragging across his face as he peered at Midoriya's lips and then pulled back, "I won't lose this fight." 
A bright red, rosy blush came over his cheeks, and Touya fought with every inch of himself to not go back for seconds and thirds and forevermore.
He released Midoriya and stood up, "Prepare yourself," he said, waving over his shoulder as he walked out, his hero commission application under his arm.
