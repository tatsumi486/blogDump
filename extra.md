### backline tanker

Natsuo stared at him for a long moment. "You... want me?"
"Us," Touya amended.
"Right, us."
Midoriya looked back down on the ground.
"I... That's selfish, isn't it?" he gave a toothy grin, "I heard that S-Rankers were often selfish."
But his fingers were trembling. 
"Not really," Natsuo said, reaching out to grab his hand. He gave a wide grin, a soft pink dusting the apple of his cheeks as he beamed back at Midoriya, "I think you can be more selfish." He squeezed, "It's not selfish to do something that makes you happy."
Touya reached forward and took Midoriya's hand.
"...You know," he said, "I don't know if I'll be able to let go."
"Then," Midoriya tilted his head, "This time, I'll come find you in the middle of the night and treat you to okonamiyaki."
Natsuo tilted his head, confused, but Toyua looked like he might break if someone says one thing too kind to him.
"...Sounds good," Touya said, a smile so small that no one other than them could find it (or would care to find it). 

-

"...Could I call you Izuku?"
Midoriya stared at Natsuo for a moment, before his face darkened considerably. Natsuo bit the inside of his cheek and repressed the urge to scream and take pictures and do things that would probably freak Midoriya out even more.
But then, his supporter gave a little shy nod, and Natsuo felt his cheeks heat up a little more. He wanted to kiss him so badly. Instead, he rubbed his nose and then gave a wide grin.
"Thanks, Izuku."
And Midoriya, red up to his ears, nodded again.
Coming up behind them, steps almost silent, Touya slung an arm around Midoriya and peered in closer.
"What about me?" he asked, his bottom lip jutting out just a little bit, "Can I call you Izuku, too?"
And Natsuo frowned, because why did Touya have to ask like he's some drunk businessman harassing a young JK late at night? 
"I like it," Midoriya said, covering his smile with his hands as he looked at the ground. "It's nice having someone call me by my name again."
Which sounded like a can of worm that shouldn't be opened right before they enter a gate. 
"Ah, but you call Nii-chan "Dabi", right?"
Midoriya nodded back, and then, stopped. Dabi, whose arm was still around Midoriya, stopped too. He looked down at the same time the young man peered up at him.
"Dabi isn't your name," he said suddenly, "is it?"
"It's my quirk," the older man replied. "I... wasn't in a good mindscape when you found me". At that time, telling you my name would have made it worse for me. Being a Todoroki and all. Either you'd help because I'm a Todoroki, or you'll try to kill me, because I'm a Todoroki." He pulled his arm off of him and moved to stand in front of him. "But right now, I'm your Dabi or your Touya, your attacker or whatever you want." He gave a wide grin, "And yours."
"Damn," Twice whispered, "He's so cool."
"Who the hell confesses right before we enter a gate?" Aizawa hissed out. 
"Aw, Shota, don't be a spoilsport, look how cute he is."
"Fucking peanut gallery," Touya deadpanned.

-

Natsuo was on his phone, scrolling down, and then laughed.
"Hey," he said, picking his head up. "Izuku, busy?"
Midoriya, who was holding a mana crystal in his lap, looked up from where he was engraving runes onto it with a finger. "Hm?"
Natsuo walked over to him, avoiding the magic seals scattered on the ground with practiced ease and crouched down next to him. "Look at this," he said, showing his phone screen.
On the screen, a small kitten laid sleeping. After a second, its legs started kicking out wildly and it woke itself up. In another few seconds, it laid its head back down and started to sleep again.
Midoriya's face broke into a wide grin.
"...Cute," he said quietly.
Natsuo, watching the joy radiate off of him, smiled back warmly. Despite there being enough magical energy to power a city swirling in the crystal that Midoriya was holding, Natsuo felt so endeared by someone half his size and weight.

### way back home

>> kan needs a story dude

"Well, how long do you think he'll even last?"
"Hm... I'll give him one month," Snipe said. 
"Wow, that's generous," Cementoss whistled. "Then, I'll be two weeks."
Midnight laughed back, "Oh children. He'll be mine at the end of the week-"
A foot came to the table between them and kicked it as hard as he could. The cards, money, and cups of alcohol went clattering to the ground and Kan, who it was kicked towards, slowly brought his eyes up to glare at the man who kicked it down.
"He's mine," Aizawa declared loudly to all of them, expression devoid of all emotion. Looking at him, no one would think that someone as bored as him would make such a desicive and certain claim over someone else. 
There was a long silence as he looked down on all of them before he turned to leave.
"Wait, Aizawa! You're paying for all of this!" Snipe snapped back.
Aizawa replied by lifting his middle finger to them.

-

"Kan."
Kan's lips stretched into a yawn, and then he turned to his longtime... co-worker? He wasn't sure what to call their relationship, but saying that they were 'friends' sounded too innocent. Inui didn't steal his customers as often as Aizawa or Shirakumo did, and it wasn't like Yamada, who actively sabotaged him. It wasn't like Kan had punched him an inch into his life like what he did with Snipe, or beat up hs significant others or what it was that Midnight called her pets. 
"What?"
As the person who lost in mahjong, again, he was in charge of cleaning up all the glasses for the night, again. He was just hoping that Lunchrush had some snacks for him.
"...I'll do it tonight," he said.
"Huh?" Kan was floored.
"You're on dish-duty again, right? I'll take care of it. Just go."
Good things did not just happen. Not to people like them. Kan frowned, beyond suspicious. 
"The new guy," Inui said, "Don't get too close to him."
And Kan arched an eyebrow, because he didn't think that they were close enough that they would look after each other like this. In fact, they weren't close at all. He was pretty sure the last time they talked, it was to escort a more violent guest out off their premise, last week.
He frowned. Kan was a lot of things, did a lot of bad things, continued to do a lot of bad things, but if there was something that annoyed him to no end, it was someone butting into his life, and making decisions for him.
Kan's like was a long list of bad decisions, but they were all his.

-

"They call me Lunchrush," he said.
Midoriya bowed his head. "Hello, Lunchrush-san," he said. He gave him an uncertain smile. "I understand that I have a lot of shortcomings, but I will do my best."
Lunchrush stared at him, a pensive stare that gagued him, and Midoriya hoped that there was something he could do.
Then, Lunchrush pointed at the frieghtening mountain of dishes. 
"Every one you break, you pay for."
"Yes sir!"
A hero who made ends meet by washing dishes. Midoriya felt like there was a joke in there, but he was too tired to find it.

-

"Look at this," Inui said, voice low as he lifted the dirty cup up. "You'd let someone drink out of this?"
Midoriya flinched but understood. He bowed forward, "I'm sorry."
"You don't know how to wash dishes? If you're going to be that lazy, then just fucking leave."
"I'm sorry."
"You think that just apologizing is good enough? A customer called it out on us! We had to comp his entire fucking night! Where do you think that money is going to come out of! Your mistake is a reflection on all of us!"
He slammed the shot glass onto the table.
"We're just as dirty as this shot glass now!"
"I'm sorry," Midoriya replied, because there was nothing else he could say.
It didn't matter that Midoriya didn't wash that cup. It didn't matter that Midoriya wasn't responsible for the dirty shot glass. It didn't matter he thought or the fact that Inui was holding the wrong person responsible. In reality, Inui was not in charge of kitchen management. He should have taken this to Lunchrush and Midoriya should, if he had any blame to take, taken the grieveneces through him.
But there was nothing clean about a business who hired an underage child to work at a host club. The rules were muddled, but as an active participant in it, Midoriya understood that he had no place to complain.
He didn't flinch when Inui hit him, and remained standing to accept it.
It wasn't as shocking as he thought it would be. Midoriya wondered if it was because he was finally used to living here, among strangers with familiar faces.
More than the ache against his cheek, Midoriya felt lonely. 
"I'm sorry," he said, bowing again, "I will be more careful."
The next time Inui smacked him, Midoriya thought he didn't hit as hard as he could have. In that second, he understood that the man was probably much kinder than he let on. The dull throb in his cheek wasn't so bad.

-

"...What happened?"
Midoriya leaned into Aizawa's cold touch, and hummed.
"I... learned how to wash dishes today," he said.
"With your face?"
"It was a hard lesson."
The fingers holding his chin tightened.
"Is it worth it?"
Midoriya grinned back. "Yeah, I learned something I wouldn't have learned otherwise."
And maybe, by the time he got back, he'd be so good at lying that even he wouldn't believe that he was tired anymore. 
Hard work, he understood, was the same in any world. It didn't lie. Persistance, in any world, was also the same.
With a wide grin, he'd prove that to Aizawa-sensei, as many times as he needed to.

-

"How come you're not asking for my real name?" Lunchrush suddenly asked one day.
Midoriya blinked at him. "...Should I?"
"Aren't you curious?" he asked, and then made a motion at his face, "about how I look?"
"I am," Midoriya replied back, too tired to pretend. "But you know," he gave him a tired, almost goofy grin, "It's like I'm working with a superhero, you know? I don't know his name or how he really looks under the mask, but when he's here, I feel like I'm okay."
He scrubbed at the dish, and satisfied with how his face was reflected back, placed it into the drying rack. His fingertips, despite wearing rubber gloves, were all pruny. The constant hot-cold change made him sweat and he felt nauesous at the smell of alcohol mixing with the detergent. But thinking of what Deku-kun would be able to do with the money he left behind (traveling with friends, going to university, taking it easy for a few months), living in a world that wasn't marred by a hundred-year walking-curse and a society split by their definition of justice.
He once heard that the life of crime was easy. He believed it. Stealing Deku-kun's life, stealing his time, was so easy that he had no idea what happened. But living earnestly so that Deku-kun would have something to come back to? That was considerably harder.
"...You're not very bright, are you?" he asked. "That will get you killed."
"It won't," Midoriya said, "because you look after your own."
Despite popular opinion, Midoriya had his suspicions on who was leaving him the snacks in the refridgerator, and who left an ice pack in his bag, and gave a grin.
He was okay. 

-

"Do you resent me?"
Midoriya's head snapped up to where Yamada looked down at him. A smile on his face, orange-tinted sunglasses on his face, he would have looked like a small-time villain if Midoriya didn't associate him with kindness and heroics.
"No?" the young man tilted his head, "Why would I?"
"...The job's hard. Aren't you upset about that?"
Midoriya stared at his hands, and wondered what this man was looking for. He sighed and stood back up.
"It's a job. It's not supposed to be easy," he replied back. "I'm just glad that there is a way for me to make money." Straightening up, he gave a polite bow, "Thank you for your reccomendation."
Yamada stared at him and then grabbed his hair. Yanking him back up,  he stared at him. Midoriya winced at the rough treatment, but he didn't complain. He didn't even look upset. 
"I don't get you," the blond said, shaking him around by the hair for a bit. He didn't look bothered at the fact that he was dragging Midoriya by the hair. "Get angry. Be upset. Your life sucks."
Midoriya blinked at him, and for a moment, could forget the pain and everything. With a small smile, he shook his head, "It's not that bad."
He frowned back.
"It's not like I'm alone," Midoriya clarified. "So I'm okay. Thank you for caring."
The blond smashed him into the wall, and then took a step back to knee him hard in the chest. Midoriya choked out, clearly not expecting that, and wondered what the fuck was wrong with everyone in the world. 
"Does that feel like I care?" he asked.
And Midoriya looked up, and wondered if he knew. Because he knew what Yamada was like when he didn't care. And that would mean that Midoriya was alone. But Midoriya was not alone. His throbbing temple and slight headache was proof of that.

-

"Not feeling it today?"
Shigaraki, leaning against the wall, didn't reply.
Unfortunately, Deku-kun's small apartment wasn't good for being alone. There were too many people in the small area. 
"The weather is nice," he said, "Why don't we go out together?"
Shigaraki glared, and for a moment, it felt like nothing would change. They were going to fight, and Midoriya needed to decide right now if he could kill him without anyone else getting hurt, since he knew that this fight wouldn't end until one or both of them were dead...
...In times like that, he wondered if he could ever be a civilian. Surely, a civilian wouldn't think like that.
But to his shock, Shigaraki did not want a fight. He did not want to fight. He didn't want to hit or swing at Midoriya. He stared and then took Midoriya's hand. He flinched, just a bit, because Midoriya was expecting a fight, expecting to be hurt, or maybe Deku-kun's body was, they were the same like that. Still, Shigaraki took his hand.
And Midoriya helped him up. Shigaraki definately gained some weight in comparison to when he first came here. Now, he stood, towering over Midoriya and finally looking more than a skeleton. 
Whenever Midoriya held hands with someone, he thought about Iida. How Ingenium always ran to hold the hand of a lost child, to remind them that they are not alone. It made it hard to let go of whoever he managed to hold. If Shigaraki had pulled his hand away, Midoriy would have let him. He could let go if someone was pulling away, he was certain of it. If they could get up on their own and move on without someone holding their hand, he would have let them go.
With that thought in mind, they left the apartment, hand-in-hand and all the way to the park. Surely other people were staring and whispering but there was a warmth in the hand in his. 
There once was a time where he would hold someone's hand, and there would be no warmth. He didn't want to rememember those instances, but it came creeping back up, like ants crawling out of their colonies. 
Under the sunlight, under the light, they lucked out at a bench in the park. Midoriya sat down, and since their hands were still interlocked, Shigaraki sat down next to him.
Hand in hand, knees touching, they sat at the park, watching the children on the playground run.
"...Am I broken?"
Midoriya jolted. It was a question that he never voiced but lingered in the back of his mind. And then he realized that Shigaraki was the one who spoke. He turned to the man.
Did he think that? When he attacked at USJ, when he laughed when Aizawa-sensei risked like and limb-
"Sometimes," he continued, "I don't know if there was something wrong with me, or if I was just born wrong. I think that if the world and I just disagreed. That I wanted to be myself and the whole world wanted me to be someone else, I think that it would be easier. That I'm broken and that I'm happy, and even a little proud to be broken, because it would be better than fitting in."
Midoriya ached. The hand holding his trembled. He hunched forward.
"I don't wanna do anything. I don't want to get up or wash my face. I don't want to learn something or work or anything. I just want to lie down and sleep. Am I... Am I broken?"
He looked to Midoriya, and Midoriya would never think that this man was a villain.
Villains were confident. They were out to hurt. They weren't...
"I don't think people can break," Midoriya said quietly. "I think that people get tired. And I think that people get hurt. And they get sick. But I don't think they're broken. They're not... toys or something. They're people."
Shigaraki's free hand came to his face. If Midoriya didn't know what he looked like as a villain, he would say that he looked like he was crying. Maybe praying. 
"I don't want to feel like this," he said. "How do I.. .get better?"
God, and what a mess this whole thing was. 
"I'm sorry," Midoriya said, because he wasn't the right person for this. "I don't know."


### returning a gift

"He does," Midoriya said, "Like you now."
Spinner blanched. Dabi? Like anyone? It felt like something was wrong with the univere. 
"He doesn't touch you anymore," Midoriya replied. "Dabi doesn't touch what's precious to him."

### kind nightmare

The thing about being smart was that being smart had nothing on making good decisions.
"...Wha..."
Dabi stared numbly at him, eyes blown wide, and Midoriya stared at him.
"You're right," he said, "Heroes only save the people they think are worth saving."
His arm bled profusely, one of the needles piercing completely through his arm, and he waited until Dabi's wide eyes met his. It was almost disconcerning, how young he looked when his eyes were so wide, and Midoriya smiled back. 
"I'm here," he said, "so don't worry." His hand came up to the needle in his arm and yanked it out. The blood ran down to his elbow and he turned over his shoulder. "I won't let anything happen to you."
It was strange. Midoriya vividly remembered losing his mind the first few times he got lost in this dungeon. The pain that inched him closer to despir, the panic that threatened to strangle him, seemed to fade away like it never happened. 
Instead, he stood, firm and certain.
There was someone here to protect. As if Midoriya needed any other reason to stand. 
If he saved someone, if he only saved one person, he wondered if he could just be a hero for the moment.
