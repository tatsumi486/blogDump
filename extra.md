"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

### way back home 

When Aizawa placed Midoriya down, the young man immediately turned his face to bury it in his blankets. At once, his heart sank. 
No, no, that was a lie. He must have eaten too much of his own cooking. That's the only reason why he felt like this. 
He placed his hand on Midoriya's head, pushing his hair back and then he heard it.
"'M fine mom," he said, "I'm okay."
And because Midoriya was prime-time entertainment and no other reason, Aizawa remembered this moment. 
When he returned to his flat, he sniffed his shirt. Was it the cigarette?

-

"Ah, Sensei!"
Aizawa felt his entire body freeze up and his head snapped over. Obviously, since Midoriya was a student, it was pretty obvious that he would have multiple teachers, but that wasn't what Aizawa was thinking.
Instead, he saw the very unimpressive Koichi and felt his temper flare.
They were nothing alike. 

-

"I don't get it," Aizawa said, crouching down to where Koichi coughed miserably on the ground. "I barely hit you twice."
Midoriya's Sensei wheezed on the ground. Was he playing? Theories rolled around in his head, and he came onto an abrupt conclusion. If Midoriya learned from this guy, then of course he wasn't fighting back when someone came to hurt him. Instead, he should...
"Midoriya-kun's pretty cute, isn't he?" he said, and almost started to grin when the man stiffened. Bingo. "Ah, I could hardly believe how small he is," he continued, the lingering feeling of holding Midoriya that one time when he got sick still tingling his arms. "Thoughtful too," he added, remembering that small smile when he managed to get Yamada and Shirakumo to wait for him after shift. "I'm a little jealous that you get to see him in class."
Obviously, these were all things to get him riled up. From the way he was pushing himself off the ground, Aizawa had no doubts. This must be Midoriya's Sensei, and therefore the reason why Midoriya stood in the mouth of that alleyway, a year and three days ago.
"Don't... touch my student," the man said. 
This was it, Aizawa thought, a grin on his face. Finally, a target.
He'll show them all. He was no one's replacement.
"Make me."

-

Aizawa stared, mildly impressed but also annoyed to hell. Midoriya was such a great fighter, so why was his Sensei like this? Augh, no wonder Midoriya fought so desperately whenever he saw him in a fight. If he thought that he was as weak as his Sensei, he understood. He didn't want to, but he understood.
And still, the man crawled forward. Aizawa broke several of his fingers and the forearm of his left arm, but he was still crawling with them. If it didn't annoy him so badly, he would have thought it was cool. 
"I... I won't let... you touch... my student," he heaved out. Impressive concerning the fact that at least two of his ribs were broken. Most people wold have passed out from the pain, but his eyes were bright with the desire to protect something. "I'll protect... my student."
Looking at the pitiful state of the man, a laugh spilled out of his lips.
This guy? What was so great about him? the fact that he didn't give up? This guy was just the same as all the other damned teachers, maybe even worse. They say pretty words like they "care about their students" and only want "the success for their students" and that they "believe in their students" but when it came down to it, they couldn't do anything. There was nothing similar between the two of them. Aizawa wouldn't abandon Midoriya. Aizawa wouldn't let Midoriya fight alone. He would walk him home and wait for him and make him dinner and get good at cooking-
"Oh my god, Shota!"
And fucking Yamada. Yamada got in the way of everything. Yamada always got in the way of everything. Midoriya, who still flinched when Aizawa ruffled his hair, leaned against Yamada during the last movie they watched together. It didn't make any sense but he knew it was Yamada's fault. 
"Shota! Calm down!"
And Shirakumo. Don't get him started on that slimey shithead. Midoriya didn't jolt when Shirakumo reached around him to get to the cabinents. They spent more time together. He even made Midoriya laugh that one time. It was different. The injuries he caused was all healed. His knuckles were healed. They-
"Get off me!" 
Just him. Aizawa thought. It was just him. Because he was never Aizawa to Midoriya. 

-

"...Aizawa-san, do you-"
"Shota."
Midoriya bliniked at him. Aizawa fought the blush as hard as he could. He coughed into his fist and rubbed the back of his neck.
"My name. Call me by it."
And in these moments, Aizawa was suddenly reminded that Midoriya was as young as he appeared, and his face flushed a bright red. Red like a cherry, Aizawa's eyes widened, as though it would help him engrave this moment, that image, into his heart. He stared, his mind emptying out as Midoriya's arms came up to cover his face.
"Ah," he said, quieter than normal but the sound echoed inside of Aizawa. "That's... I... Are you sure?"
"Yeah," Aizawa nodded, but there was so much more than just this. This was just the start.
It was the least he could do to Midoriya, who came to that alleyway, looking for the wrong person. No one was too young to learn about consequeneces, and all that.
"...Sh..." It wouldn't have shocked him if steam started to come out of his ears. "Sho..." Green eyes were murky, as though his head was spinning, trying to do this.
Aizawa never considered himself a patient man but...
"...Shota..."
He covered his mouth, understanding why people valued it so much. 
"...san?"
"Yes?" he asked, a smile on his face, "You called?"
"I... I'll work on it," Midoriya said, more precious than any gem in the world.
"Before I'm old and gray, please," he said.
"Then, at least I have plenty of time," Midoriya laughed.
Did it sound the same to Midoriya as it did him? It almost sounded like Midoriya planned to be there for him, until he was old and gray. The thought permeated into his head. It made his heart ache. He hated it. 
"Don't test my patience," Aizawa grouched out, ruffling his hair roughly. He didn't bother hiding his grin when he heard Midoriya yelp.
Aizawa hated it so much that he thought about it for days and weeks and months afterwards.

"I wanna be a better person," Shimura said. "I want to be a person that you'd like."
"...Those are two different people," Midoriya replied back, cautiously.
Shimura stared back at him. "then I wanna be a person that you can rely on."
"...Would... Would it even be worth it?"
The older man chuckled at that, laughing at something that Midoriya had no idea about.
"You don't do something because you think it'll be worth it," he said, but it didn't sound like they were his words. It felt more like he was epeaing something from someone else, maybe a book? "We call it kindness because we're selfish."
He reached his hand out, and this time, Midoriya stared at it for a moment before taking it.
"What if... I'm not someone worth your time and effort?"
Shimura's hand tightened around Midoriya, as though to make sure that he was real and solid before he relaxed his grip again, and he shrugged.
"Can't imagine it. Hard to come up with an answer to something I can't imagine, but you know, if we keep taking things on step at a time, I think we'll find an answer," he replied back. And he turned back with a lopsided grin, "And we'll look back at this moment and wonder why we thought it was so hard."
He squeezed their hands once more.
"Together."
He gave this exasperated huff, as he took a step closer. He raised his other hands slowly, and stilled when Midoriya stiffened. After a quiet second, the back of his fingers came to wipe under his eyes.
"I am here," Shimura said. "Take your time."
Midoriya cried. Silent tears that rolled down his face as his shoulders trembled. Shimura released his hand and slowly pulled him into an embrace instead. He didn't say anything, and Midoriya's hands came to clutch to the sides of his shirt. 
Comfort was a strange thing, if only because Midoriya didn't experience it enough to know what it was or what to do with it.

-

"Touya-san and Shimura-san will be out late for work," Midoriya said quietly, wary eyes looking between the three. "But I haven't heard from Takami-san-"
His phone rang then. He gave the three an apologetic look.
"Excuse me," he said, before taking it. 
His eyes read over the test and he sighed.
"Nevermind, Takami-san said he'll be at work," he said. "S-sorry for interupting your evening-"
"So you're going to be alone tonight?" Yamada asked.
His back goes ramrod straight, and the fear is obvious in his eyes. He took a step back, features paling as his hands trembled-
"Whoa, whoa, easy, we're just going to ask if you want dinner with us tonight," Yamada said. "The more the merrier, right?"
"It's okay to say no," Aizawa spoke up, eyes sharp. He looked like he wanted to say something else, but the last man spoke up.
"But we'll be happy if you came with us. Shota's a sourwuss when you're not in eyeshot."



"He has a knife in his hand," Midoriya pointed out.
Yamada laughed, a loud sound that didn't scare him anymore, "Aw, you worried about me?" he asked. "Don't worry, Shota won't hurt anyone with the kitchen knife."
"...Really?"
The blond grinned back, "Of course not! He uses that knife to feed his favorite person!"
"...Shirakumo-san?"
The blond's smile fell, "Ah uh. Not quite."
Midoriya thought a little harder about it. "...You?"
"Really close. Like distance-wise."
"...You and Shirakumo-san?"
"It's all three of of you," Aizawa called out, without turning away from the cutting board. He placed his knife down and looked at Midoriya, "Oboro. Hizashi. Deku," he listed, a small smile on his face. "My most favorite people."
And Midoriya's face flushed, but Yamada's shoulders slackened and his eyes widened.
"Oh," he said. "Me too?"
Aizawa returned to cutting, his expression blank again. "I'm not repeating it."
Yamada covered his mouth, face flushed as he turned to Midoriya.
"Don't worry," he said, "You guys are my favorite people too!"
Midoriya's gaze turned curious, and quietly he asked, "What does that mean?" he asked, "to be someone's favorite?"
"It means that I made you dinner," Aizawa said, "grab Oboro and let's eat together."
