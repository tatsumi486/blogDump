"So, what do you want me to do?" Chimera asked, leaning against the doorframe. "I'd rather not be put on food-duty. Don't want that kind of responsibility if shit hits the fan," he said, "I do better in smaller teams. Aerieal-support, extra muscle, if it's fighting, I won't lose."
Izuku passed him a piece of paper. "Layout."
"Oh? You're just going to give it to me?"
"Go to every house marked with 'X' and break the locks."
Chimera took the paper, unfolding it and already started to map it out based on where they were. He hadn't taken a lap around the block, but he supposed that it was now time to do so.
"Yes sir. I'll leave right now-"
"Be back by midnight."
Ah, was this it? A test? Chimera, who had been itching for a way to prove himself, felt like he would burst with pride.

-

"Kon, are you on the line?"
Izuku's voice crackled to life on the line, and despite the number of people that could have answered him, there was only one voice that he was willing to listen to.
"Go ahead, Boss," Chimera's voice returned on the line.
"Get to the fourth floor, keep your eye on the street towards the east. I need cover-fire to the bank."
"On it."
The line fell silent, and it crackled back to life.
"Izuku-sama, we're wrapping up by residental," Spinner called in as well. 
The resulting silence was deafening, as though Spinner hadn't spoken at all. 
"...Izuku," Chimera's voice returned, "I can't get the right side of the sidewalk. I'm ready otherwise."
"Copy. Heading out."
For those who were just listening, it was hard to think that this newcomer managed to become the one and only person that Izuku coordinated something with.

-

There was a polite knock, and understanding that there wouldn't be an answer, Aizawa sighed. "Izuku, it's Aizawa. I have the reports." He gave another second, trying to forget that image from before, and then said, "I'm coming in."
He pushed the door open, when he heard a hiss.
Kicking the door down, his hand pulled out his handgun and he froze.
In front of him, with his shirt off and the stench of blood in the air, was Izuku. Sitting next to him with a first-aid kit and a hand on a gun pointed back at Aizawa, was Chimera. Kicking Izuku's chair so that he rolled behind him, Chimera slowly moved to stand in front of him, as though to be a body shield for the young man.
Which was perposterous, because Aizawa wouldn't, didn't want to, ever think about hurting Izuku.
"Put the reprts on the desk," Izuku spoke up. "Kon, are you done?"
Chimera put his gun done, but didn't look away from Aizawa as he slowly backed up. Aizawa, reluntantly, looked from Izuku, the nasty cut on his shoulder and upper arm, and then holstered his gun. Inside, he felt the alpha in him scream and claw its way to the surface.
Aizawa, who had been here for over a year, who had been nothing but patient and painstakingly needling his way up into Izuku's good graces, didn't even know that Izuku was injured. And here Chimera was, some packless alpha, who was giving Izuku first-aid. 
Try as he might, he bared his teeth. 
Chimera bared his right back.
The silence was broken when Izuku sighed and stood up. Grabbing some of his reports, his hand reached for one of the bandages when Chimera's paw came to rest on top of his hand.
"I'll do it," he said. Ears pinned down against his head, he ducked his head and broke eyecontact from Aizawa.
Despite the obvious show of submission, that Chimera broke off before Aizawa, the former teacher felt no victory. For still, Izuku placed all his things down and sat back in his seat. Chimera kneeled down next to him with the bandages again. 
In Aizawa's head, he knew and understood that he had no place here. 

-

"You don't even know that?"
Izuku's jaw clicked shut. With a split second, all emotion was eradicated off his face as he took a deep breath in through his nose and slowly out through his mouth.
And it helped that while he did that, Shigaraki grabbed the man by the front of his shirt and shook him hard. A snarl on his lips, he forced the man down onto his knees.
"Watch it."


"How come you're-" and Twice wanted to scream and fight and kill if it would make this awful feeling go away, "-you're punishing us for something that they did?!"
And Izuku, who lived believing that he was alone, that he was always alone, felt a blistering rage return to his heart like it never left. 
"All you heroes," he said, and Twice's face twisted in his confusion, as Izuku continued, "All you villains, all you alphas..."
Dabi's head snapped up, as did Nighteye's. Look at them, pretending to pay attention. Come and watch a spectacular performance that the remains at Aldera High School put together. A comedy, because when else would an alpha pretend to care about some omega, starring a stupid omega. 
"...It doesn't matter," he said. The burning fit of rage slowly smoked out. Izuku wondered if this was what defeat felt like. "It doesn't fucking matter." His shoulders slumped and ran his hand through his hair.
"W-What?" Twice stammered and then he moved to stand in front of Izuku. His hands came to his shoulders, gripping them tightly, and leaned down in front of him. "It's not... Of course it matters. It's not about alphas or omegas or-or-or civilians or anything like that." His hands slid down to Izuku's elbows, and he dropped to his knees, in hopes that he could meet Izuku's eyes. "It's about you and me. Just Izuku and Jin, you know?"
Izuku stared back. He opened his mouth, and then closed it. He looked away, but Twice wouldn't let him go this time.
"You see, I didn't have anyone before this. I mean, I had a friend and he relly looked after me, but like, we were just two assholes. We were villains, yeah, and we deserve everything we got coming but if I died or anything, no one would notice and no one would care. And actually, if someone did notice, then they would say that it was good that I kicked the bucket."
"Get to the point," Izuku's voice was cold. Unfeeling. It made his heart flutter in his chest. 
"...Here, things are different. If I'm in trouble, someone will come running. If I'm late, someone will notice. If I work or don't work, someone tells me 'good morning' and 'have a nice day'. When I come back, someone says 'welcome back' and there's people that know about me and my," he made a wild motion at his head, "and still, they say hello."
His hands grabbed Izuku's and clasped them together. Dropping his forehead onto him, he said.
"Thank you, Izuku. I know I don't say it often but really, thank you. I never thought that this was something I could have."
With a deep breath, he stood up.
"So whatever happens, whatever you think, I wanna take your side. I wanna stay by your side. I know I'm not smart or-or strong or really useful but I wanna do what I can for you."
From the look on Izuku's face, however, everyone could tell that the young man had no idea what to do with this situation. 


### apoc

In the time that Enji had scolded the others for only assuming responsibility because they knew what Helmet looked like, he understood that he had fallen into the same rut. 
Because at some point, he did expect Deku's performance to suffer. Instead, he stood like a hypocritical idiot, mouth agape as Deku came crashing in from the side. Regardless of the size, there weren't many thing that could handle being attacked on the side like that. The beast that had managed to corner Endeavor had a knife in it's throat, and with Deku twisting his body down and gravity, the blade created a downwards arc on the monster. The impressive display of intertia and speed created a downpour of blood before the monster slumped to the side. 
Deku jumped backwards into a roll and then up on his feet. Chest moving rapidly, he turned to Enji.
"Deku," Enji said, breathless. "T...Thank you."
The young man, regardless if he heard him or not, faced back forwards to the monster. Walking over, he plunged his knife into its throat a few more times, until its head came loose and rolled away. 
Distrubing, but Enji knew there was no one more thorough than Deku. 
He couldn't believe that he needed to be reminded of that. Him? Save Deku? Help Deku? What a joke. 
The fire under his burned. Inept. Incompetent.
If Deku had known what he actually was, Enji wondered if he would have been saved. 

-

"Just worry about yourself," Deku said.
His words were cold. Momentarily, he was caught off-guard. It was strange to think that all these colorful array of heroes (and children) would adhere to those words. 
It was stranger still to think that the guy who came so gallantly to save a stranger would say something like that. 
And then, suddenly, Chimera understood. 
Deku thought he was a weakling that could barely keep his own ass out of danger. 
The notion was so wild that he couldn't do anything other than snort. Ridiculous. Sure, they met on a bad day, but a bad day wasn't everyday.
Straightening out, he moved to stand next to Deku.
"I'll make you eat those words," Chimera said. And obviously, he meant it in good humor. 
From the way those green eyes seemed to shine, Deku understood. From the way Spinner's hand came to his blade, the others clearly didn't.

-

"It's some... water-balloon thing? Like, you know those old games? Slimes?"
"...What?"
"I don't know how else to explain it," Tensei said, "but like, a big bubble, filled with water, rolling about-"
"It's acid," Deku's voice suddenly sounded over the walkie. "Snipers at the ready. They all have a rock inside of them. Break that."
Acid.
Deku already figured out it was acid, and how to kill it. Concerning how he fought, it was obvious how. 
"They're distracted by vibrations. Break something next to it and it'll come."

"He can't join anyone's guild or make one," Touya said, placing the papers down. "He's a minor."
Natsuo's arms crossed over his chest. "Damn, guess we're back to the waiting game."
Hawks hummed, "One sec." He took the papers into his hands as he stood up. Pulling a phone out, he tapped a few things before he placed it against his ear. "Yeah, skipping formalities. He wants a guild."
Midoriya tilted his head, and Touya covered his mouth. Natsuo's jaw dropped open and Hawks gave them a big thumbs-up.
"I'll let them know." He turned to them. "You got a name?"
"Deku," Midoriya said, "A guild for people who work uselessly hard."
There was a silence between them, and Midoriya smiled back. He gave a little shrug, suddenly shy.
"Or... something like that?"
"...My heart just skipped a beat," Hawks replied back. He spoke into the phone. "Deku. A guild for people who work uselessly hard."

-

"You're not a Deku," Touya said, pulling Midoriya into his lap and leaning in to kiss his jaw. "You know that, right?"
Coming from behind, Natsuo kissed his cheek and then his forehead.
"You're not useless, and we won't let your hard work go to waste," he promised. 
But instead of replying quickly, Midoriya hesitated. 
"Me too," he said. "I don't want to be useless anymore." He gave a small smile. "Let's do our best."
The arms around his waist tightened, "Don't work too hard," Natsuo said. His head dropped to his shoulder.
Touya tilted his head, carefully observing his brother before he leaned in to kiss Midoriya. His hands found Natsuo's, and squeezed once, just to let him know that he understood. 
It would be painfully easy for Deku to leave them in the dust.

-

"But could a supporter clear a gate on their own?"
"...Are you actually watching this garbage?" Touya asked, toweling his hair with a frown. "You know none of those guys are hunters, right?"
"Yeah," Natsuo replied easily, but he still didn't turn it off.
"Of course not!" one of the hosts said. "An extremely capable hunter may be able to handle a gate two ranks below them with ease, but a supporter wouldn't be able to clear it at all, regardless of what the gate is ranked at!"
"What about the new S-Class Supporter, Midoriya-kun?"
"Well, I suppose there are exceptions to everything. For the most part, Supporters have fragile defenses and little to no attacks. Midoriya-kun had demonstrated time and time again that he stands head and shoulders above everyone else. Of course, I doubt that even he could clear an S-Rank on his own, but hopefully, he would never need to."
"Or rather, he might just find someone inside the gate that could help him fight!"
The audience on the screen laughed, even though there was nothing funny about the fact that people got lost in the gates, and that they had a dedicated pile of mail of people begging Midoriya to find their lost-beloveds in gates. 
Blue eyes flitted from the TV to his brother and then back. A frown on his face, he moved to stand in front of his brother, reached for the remote and turned it off.
The resulting silence was deafening. Natsuo's eyes locked to the ground, and Touya kneeled down in front of him. 
"...What are you thinking about?" he asked. "And why did you think that you can't talk to me about it? Answer those two and I'll let you go."
"...Is this an interrogation?" Natsuo asked, a small smile on his face.
"Or else I'll eat all your ice cream in the fridge."
"You don't like pitaschio," he replied quietly.
"Yeah, but I'll do it if it'll make you talk."
Natsuo's bottom lip trembled. 
"You know that saying, 'hard work beats talent'?" Natsuo asked.
There was a brief silence, and Natsuo placed his head into his hands. 
"What... What happens when 'talent works hard'? What happens to us then?"
Touya stared back, and moved to sit next to Natsuo on the couch instead. He leaned back with a long sigh. 
"...We become Dekus," he said, "and work hard, no matter how useless it is. Slowly, bit by bit. How we do anything."
A watery laugh escaped Natsuo's lips.
"Damn," he said.
Because that just meant that Touya had no fucking clue either.
Somehow, without any concrete answers, Natsuo still felt better. It was funny how that worked.
"And, we should tell Izuku."
"I..." a pit opened up in his gut and he felt nauseous, "What?"
"You want to hide it from him?" Touya replied, arching an eyebrow. "...You don't think he's reliable?"
"No, no," Natsuo shook his head. "But... I don't want to worry him either."
"Do you think that he wouldn't be worried anyways?"
He hesitated, and Touya frowned.
"Natsuo, what the hell do you think Izuku is?"
He flinched backwards, and the older man sighed.
"Well, you have two weeks to come clean before I do it for you," Touya replied. "and if Izuku asks, I'll tell him how much time you have left."
Natsuo grimaced. "Do... Do I have to?"
"You don't," Touya replied back, "but the faster we get into the habit of this, the better."
"You... You really think so?"
Touya stared at Natsuo for a moment and then nodded.
"Natsuo, being alone in a dungeon is a terrible thing," he said. "It gets into your head and you begin to think and really believe that you are alone. And after a while, everything and everyone around you starts to look like monsters. You get what I'm trying to say?"
Natsuo shook his head.
"Yeah, you were never bright," Touya sighed. "I'm saying that we're not monsters. We're a party. You're not alone. You're not telling Izuku to inform him of this. You're telling Izuku so you don't forget your party." 
"...What about you?" Natsuo asked quietly, "Do you remember that we're a party?"
Touya tilted his head and gave him a crooked grin. 
"My, Nat-kun got a backbone now, huh?" 
Blushing at the childhood nickname, he spluttered back. Touya's gaze was gentle.
"The things I'm worried about are your nomral things," he said. "And most of them are fixed with a google search."
"Yeah, but... I don't know. You should say something if you really think it, you know?"

-

Midoriya took one look at Natsuo and his smile fell.
Natsuo understood, in that second, that he couldn't hide anything worth shit. Maybe it was because he never had anyone to hide something from before, but it was as relieving as it was a little embaressing. 
Because Midoriya pursed his lips, and looked down at the ground. He scuffed his feet on the ground and then looked back up at Natsuo.
"Are..." he hesitated, and then changed his words, "I uhm... I was wondering..."
Natsuo felt something inside of him loosen. He came, ready to talk about this and bring it up, but the situation was much different than he was expecting.
"Izuku," he said, "Thanks for coming over." He took a step back and opened the door wider and motioned him in with a smile. "Come on in. You want some tea?"
Midoriya stared back and then nodded back. Natsuo closed the door, staring at the locks for a moment longer than he needed to. The silence fell between them, heavy in its atmosphere.
"Niichan's in the living room," he said, "I'll be right out."
"Okay." 
Deep breaths, Natsuo thought to himself as he watched the water boil. Deep fucking breaths. Even though, in his head, he knew that Midoriya wouldn't walk out on him because of this, and that Midoriya wasn't someone that chose people by their qualifications. He knew that, had seen that, but somehow, the enroaching subject was terrifying. 
Admitting to Midoriya that he wasn't good enough was terrifying him. Like that, it was set in stone. Not only was it a problem, but he was aware that it was a problem. He hated that. 
Taking a deep breath, he headed out with three hot cups of tea. He shouldn't put this off any longer. His anxiety would cripple him at this rate.
"So uh," Natsuo sat in front of them, passing the cups out, and then sat down. "I need to tell you something."
Midoriya took the tea into his hands and nodded his head.
"I'm listening."
Two words, and Natsuo felt his strength return to him.
"...I uh... You're strong, Izuku. Really strong. I... I don't think I'll ever catch up to you, kind of strong," he said. 
When it looked like Midoriya would say something, Touya dropped his hand to his shoulder.
"Let him finish."
Natsuo shot him a grateful look, because he wasn't sure he could explain this after he stopped once. He took a deep breath and kept going.
"I don't want you to think that you had to stay with us because we have this relationship. If you want to go and fight in higher ranks with stronger fighters-" and he could feel himself choke on his words, because he could just see Hawks, that damn grin on his face, but wanted Midoriya to come home alive more than anything else, and kept speaking, "-it's okay."
Because unlike Natsuo, Midoriya truly did love going into gates.
"And I'm sorry that I'm not strong enough," he continued. His eyes started to water, and this was it, he was going to disappoint Midoriya. His throat closed, and Natsuo wondered why he's never been good enough. "But I don't want to hold you back. I'm-" his voice broke because he even disappointed himself, "-I'm sorry that I'm not enough-"
Midoriya stood up, and Natsuo flinched. In his head, it made sense. People leave when there is nothing woth staying for. He would have done the same. If Touya didn't stick so faithfully here, he wouldn't have ever-
Midoriya sat down next to him, and took his hand. His tiny hand reached for Natsuo's, and uncurled his clenched fist. Laying their palms together, their fingers loosely next to each other, he spoke quietly.
"I've never thought that you weren't good enough," Midoirya said, "because there's so much of the world I wouldn't have known or understood without you."
Natsuo felt his throat close and his shoulder tremble.
"For me, gate-raids weren't fun until I started to go with you and Touya," he said, squeezing his hand. Natsuo's head snapped up, shocked to hear that, because he had been so convinced that it was just him who felt like that. The confirmation that he wasn't alone was shocking, and it felt so kind that for a moment, Natsuo felt like he was bewitched. "If there is a gate that needs to be cleared, I will go but I..." he looked up and smiled at Natsuo, "I like going with you as my tank. I like being with you."
Natsuo blinked twice, and his vision started to blur. 
"Before I partied with you and Touya, I had to go in as an E-Rank healer for the public gates with the Commission," he explained. "And it was hard. I didn't think it was then, but thinking back to those days, I think it was really hard. I couldn't stay awake in class. Going home was too painful. And since I was suddenly the breadwinner, I had to go raiding. Some days, I wished that I wasn't a survivor from the Aldera Incident, but one of the people who died."
A shiver ran down his spine, and Natsuo turned to where Midoriya's smile shined back at him.
"Thank you," Midoriya said, "for inviting me to be in your party. I never thought that raiding was something that could be fun, until I went with you and Touya."
Natsuo's hand curled around Midoriya's smaller hand. He turned around and pulled the young man against his chest and when he felt Touya's hand on his back, felt the wall he created to protect his heart shatter away. Ugly sobs broke from his heart, from the six year old Natsuo who had to watch his older brother destroy himself in an attempt to impress someone that had no interest in him, from the ten year old Natsuo who wondered why he was even born, to the Natsuo who stood and listened to the fact that his brother was lost in a gate and didn't feel a thing.
He clutched to Midoriya, all but dragging him into his lap, and cried. It was as though he had condensed all the tears he couldn't shed before into a single moment.

-

"Sleep well, baby brother," Touya muttered quietly, running his fingers through his hair. "We'll be here when you wake up."

-

Touya jolted awake, and briefly, understood that the world was too damn cold. There was a chill on his back, and he felt his fire burn under his skin-
"Hasgarhan..."
He blinked. Natsuo's voice, calling out some nosncense as he rolled onto his back. Touya blinked slowly, and realized that his arms were warm. The arm he had over Midoriya's waist was warm. The young man next to him was warm.
Curling a little bit closer, Touya's eyes closed slowly, and he took a deep breath. 
A long time ago, he didn't understand what people meant by [home]. He didn't get why they were so desperate to go back to it, and why it was so important to have and protect.
A long time ago.

"The fact that I can cry," Touya said, taking Midoriya's hand against his face and holding it there, "and the fact that I do cry, is all because of you," he said.
"...Did the curry not settle well?" the supporter asked quietly. 
Touya hummed back, "Maybe." He leaned in closer.
"How are you feeling now?"
The warmth of Midoriya's hands, the soft feeling of his magic enveloping him, had a smile curling on Touya's lips.
"Guess, you're feeling better? You're smiling."
"Hm..." Touya's smile widened, and he squeezed Midoriya's hand before he met his supporter's gaze, "Maybe?"
"Let's get something easy to eat after the gate today," he said. "Like the udon from that place we went to last month."
Touya nodded, and Midoriya had no doubts that he already knew which one he was talking about. Touya had a sixth sense for that kind of thing.
"Sounds good," he agreed. 

-

"Whatdya think, Midoriya?" Hawks asked, landing next to him.
"No."
Hawks tried not to look too crushed.
"Aw, man. Well, it was worth a shot. Is there a reason why?" 
Midoriya stared at him and then looked away. "I won't be able to focus."
The blnd stared, and his cheeks started to darken.
"Oh," he said, a wide grin stretching on his lips, "Really?"
Midoriya's face flushed as he hid behind his arms.

"It's worth it," Ban Yeoryung cried. She wiped at her eyes and rubbed them hard, even red-rimmed, they were breathtaking. Fat tears ran down her face and the words came out strangled, and still, she was beautiful. "It doesn't hurt. I can do it."
"...Yeoryung?" Dan-i whispered back. As the main lead, she supposed it wouldn't be this easy.
"I'll protect it. The world where-where we eat ice cream together. The world where we s-sleep next to each other. I'll do it," she said. "I'll protect the world that I share with my Dan-i."
Dan-i, on occasion, wondered what had happened in their past, that this beautiful woman was so loyal to her. The original Ham Dan-i must have been someone equally beautiful to have earned that loyalty. 
"Yeo-ryung," she said, collecting her hands, and smiled. "Having you here is enough for me." She leaned in, pushing her long hair behind her ear, and grinned. "Every day I get to spend with you is my most precious treasure."
