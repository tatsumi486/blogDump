>> background apocalypse & eri + kouta are the only publishing mangaka

Summary: Eri huffed and placed her hands on her hips, "Well, when you can rub enough braincells together to write your own story, you can write what you want."

Kouta glared back. "One day," he seethed back, snatching the manuscript out of her hands, "One fucking day."

There are 8 Twices walking in and out of the same room. And that's how the rest of the base knows.

The next chapter is about to be released.

"And you're okay with this?" Hawks asked, waving the dj in front of Midoriya's face.

Midoriya stared at the doujin, a drawn picture of him in a rauchy bunny-suit looking up at the camera, and he sighed.

"Do you remember?" he asked, "When they first came in?"

Hawks frowned, and Midoriya looked back forward.

"I remember. Eri threw up everything she ate and cried all night. Kouta never spoke and never moved, and if anyone touched him, they'd be scratched and bitten."

The blond stared and looked down. He remembered. The first children they had seen in months, living like rats. They found Eri after Kouta, and at least they were better prepared for her, but Kouta especially was hard. Hawks remembered, one several occasions, some of the others recommending to just put him out of his misery.

"Shut up, you stupid earthworm! It's not furry, it's scaley!"

Midoriya smile kept its place, and Hawks didn't think he would ever meet someone as strong as him.

"Chisa-ji is not nearly as bad as you write him out to be," Kouta said.

Eri gave a sharp cry, sounding more like a yowl-like someone pulled the plug on Shigaraki's game again- and turned to Kouta with the promise of pain in her eyes.

"You didn't know him pre-Izu-nii."

Kouta rolled his eyes, "Yeah, but child experimentation? Come on, that's such a gimmie. Why can't you make him 3-D instead of some Jesus freak?"

Eri flushed holty, "Augh! You're so stupid, Kouta! It's just a character quirk! You said you wanted to try with the religious scriptures!"

"I never said that!" Kouta shouted right back. "Just that altar-sex would be fun to try!"

"Same difference! You just want to summon another demon, you monster-fucker!"

"You leave Chimera-san out of this!"

"So uh..." Yamada coughed into his fist, looked up and down the hallway, and then leaned in closer, "Any chance on some Present Mic/Deku?"

Kouta gave him this dead-eyed look, and as though he was just counting down to the last minute where he didn't have to be here anymore, pointed at the

And then the library system was created and there was a new acknoledgement.

No one wanted to borrow a book after Shigaraki.
