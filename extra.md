>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

Dabi felt a weight suddenly lean against him and he froze. His eyes darted to the side, and indeed, Deku's head was against his arm. 
His eyes stared at the young man, frozen stiff where he was.
"Deku," he said quietly. He didn't want to wake the young man, he always looked so exhausted, but he also didn't want the man to sleep on him like this.
In front of him, Mina walked in with a folded map, no doubt finished with her quick patrol, when she caught the two of them. She looked at Deku, then Dabi, then back, and then gave a ferocious grin.
She gave Dabi a wide grin, a big thumbs up, turned around and left.
That bitch. Asshole. Fucking help him.
And unable to move even an inch in any direction, he sat stiffly. Cursing long and hard in his head, he couldn't believe those hero-wannabe assholes.
They should have at least left their jacket so Deku had a blanket. With a forlorn sigh, he looked again at Deku, sleeping with his chin to his chest, and wished the young man could sleep more comfortably. 
He's never met Deku when he was cranky from lack of sleep. A part of him didn't want to see it, but the rest of him wouldn't mind seeing. 
Well, whatever. 
He leaned back slowly, careful not to jostle the young man. He was sensitive to everything. 
Tired, he closed his eyes, figuring that nothing would happen to him as long as Deku was next to him. Just for a moment, he thought. He was tired.

"Where's-"
"Sh!"
Enji, while he was privately glad that the others were a little more comfortable with him, felt mildly annoyed at the fact that he had just been shushed. 
But Mina smiled up at him, bright-eyed and she motioned him closer with a hushed, "Look at them!"
Enji peered over, and saw the way Dabi's head leaned on top of Deku's. The way Deku slept against Dabi's arm, mouth slightly open. Their hands rested against each other, palm to palm, Deku's arm crossing over Dabi's, and otherwise looking comfortable.
Staring at them, Enji felt a surge of pride.
Peace, he thought. All their hard work and effort had accumulated to a single moment. Everything they had done, for these 15 minutes. Eventually, it would be more. It would be much more.
"Let them rest," he said. As long as he they needed to.
Enji would protect it.
