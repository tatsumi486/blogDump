### this wont even...
"C'mon, answer me!"
And Deku stared at Shigaraki for a moment and then looked forward.
shigaraki gnashed his teeth, and he hissed.
"It didn't sound like you want an anser,' the younger man replied. 

### way back home 

"So, Midoriya-kun, where to today?" Toyomitsu asked, a wide grin on his face as he hunched over to look down at him. "Ramen? Oden?"
"It's been a while," Midoriya said, and lifted a piece of paper with a bright-colored promotion on it in front of his face, shyly hiding behind it, "Since we got okonomiyaki, right?"
Toyomitsu grinned back, and Midoriya gave a sigh of relief, 

-

"I didn't used to like Takoyaki," Toyomitsu admitted. "When I was a kid, I was big. Like, really big." He gave a hearty laugh, but the sound felt sour to Midoriya's ears. "Fatass didn't even begin to describe how big I was. I..."
He stared at the takoyaki in his hands.
"So they called me takoyaki. I was fat and ugly, and a bit of a clumsy mess, so I was just a takoyaki that was waiting to be stepped on. Lumpy and just a mess of bad things and-"
Midoriya's hand came and grabbed a few of his fingers. He squeezed, and hoped that his wordless support came to him.
Toyomitsu stared at their hands for a moment longer, his somber smile starting to regain their light, and he chuckled at a joke Midoriya didn't know.
"I hated takoyaki."
Midoriya's heart felt so empty that it felt like it would break in on itself to feel again.
"Oh," Midoriya said, thinking back to how often and how casually they had eaten it.
"...Well," Toyomitsu tilted his head and flashed Midoriya a wide grin, "I used to hate takoyaki."
His eyes watered, and Midoriya wondered if it was okay, if Toyomitsu was okay, because Midoriya didn't even notice that he was hurting. 
"AW, don't cry, Midoriya," Toyomitsu said, a laugh on his lips and stars in his eyes, "I'll let you have the last piece."
And Midoriya gave this breathless laugh, because it would be too sad to cry now.
"Let's split it," he replied back, because the last piece was the one that tasted the best. It would be a shame to eat it alone.


### post-apoc light?? Some Tower/Dungeon thing???

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_demons_in_the_Ars_Goetia 
72 Towers (1 legion ~6k) for the 72 demons -> getting key from dungeon
towers are mixed bag, but usually have floors that make no logical sense (volocanic and blizzard lands)
and all 72 keys together could unlock the boss node (or so is the hope)
society moves on and builds a gritty, smaller world in little fragments of society, taking parts of demons to make weapons in typical hunter-society 
no more heroes/villains, just Hunters (?)
it's been about 20 years since the dungeons appeared 
"Safe Zones" are areas where demons cannot enter
quirkless -> blessed hunters w/ magic 
ergo "witch hunt"
magic -> standard support stuff & ofc izuku's BAMF (lvl & love & genuine feeling + latent power)

eventually deku makes a floating island [summoner wars style that he manages off of his magic + magic crystals]
starts as an rv, then a convoy of

And Midoriya laughed, it was a bright and vibrant sound that made Hawks flinch, the way people would wince when they saw something suddenly bright. 
"This is the vision I have," he said, leaning backwards and against the railing, "A world made of green and hope. Where everyone can smile and cry together."
He looked pathetically small like that, leaning against the destroyed wall and the barren wastelands crawling with monsters behind him, and Hawks must have lost his mine.
He must have truly and honestly lost his mind, because looking at Midoriya, he felt his heart flutter and the corners of his lips pull up. 
"Yeah," he said, breathless as people were when enchanted by soemthing beyond human logic and reason. "I... I want to see it too."
A world where Midoriya smiled, he thought to himself, was a beautiful thing. 

-

"...When I said everyone," Midoriya said, his hand taking Hawks' in his, "I mean everyone."
Hawks stared, his eyes starting to well with tears, and he gave a shaky nod.
"...Okay," he said. 
If Midoriya knew about the darkness in his heart, he wondered what he would say. Would he still be able to smile like that, take his hand and share his warmth? 
His hand turned and their fingers interlaced. Midoriya's cheeks flushed a little more, and Hawks could hardly believe that this was real. That Midoriya was real.

- 

"...A self-made safe-zone?" 
Midoriya grinned back. "Yes," he said, lifting his hand up and creating a small cube of illuminiscent green to float over his hand. The casual display of magic made him step back, a conditioned response fomr having to deal with less-than-savory witches. Midoriya closed his hand around the cube, and dispelled the spell in less than a second.
"And it... runs on your magic?"
The young man nodded back. "Yes."
"...Are you..."
Midoriya reached his hand out, "Wanna check?"
And indeed, Midoriya was alive and well. No signs of fatigue and no symptoms of exhaustion. Looking at him, no one would ever think that he was the battery for a spell that could span the the entire ward of Mustafuyu.
He didn't say anything, no snarky words and no bitter phrases. Just a patient smile as he looked towards the older man.
"...I'm sorry for doubting you," he said.
"I understand," he replied.
And both of them heard that he didn't forgive him. 

-

"No, that's physically impossible," Eraserhead said, standing between Midoriya and Endeavor.
"What did you say?!" 
And Aizawa raised his voice.
"Because he's 15!" he shouted out, "He wasn't even alive during the Witch Hunt!"
All eyes swerved to Midoriya, who gave him a shy smile.
"Hello," he said, bowing his head, "I'll be 16 this summer."
"I'm in love with a 15 year old?!" Twice shouted out. 
Dabi stood up, "I'll deal with him," he said, grabbing Twice by the shoulder, "You take care of big flame over there."
Midoriya stood up and Ingenium's hands came to his shoulder and pushed him back down on his chair.
"Not you," he said easily.
Midoriya chewed on the inside of his cheek, looking worriedly between Eraserhead and Endeavor and back. 


### apoc

Moreso than hearing it or seeing it, Deku had a gut feeling. It wasn't something that he could really explain with facts and logic or even previus experience, but he just had a feeling. Some instinct. In his head, somewhere, he could hear something tug him more towards the left, and he just knew. 


-

"Well Helmet," and Twice winced before he said, "I mean, Deku."
And Deku gave a full-body jerk. No way.
No fucking way. He grabbed the railing and vaulted over from the third floor. He landed without any problems, and wasted no time. His hand shot out and grabbed Twice's hand.
"Me?" he asked, his voice coming out in ribbons.
"Y-Yeah?"
Twice stared, shocked and startled, and Deku felt his heart seize in his chest.
No, no, he wanted to beg, have standards. Twice, out of everyone especially, should be more selfish. His gratitude would be wasted on Deku. Why didn't he understand that? Twice was someone that could be happy. He deserved so much more, so why was he okay with Deku?
He couldn't understand it. He couldn't begin to comprehend it.
"I uh..." Twice stared at his hand holding his wrist, "I never thought you'd make the first move."
Deku wrenched his hand backwards like he had touched fire, and felt his hand tremble. 
"Sorry," he said, because he didn't know how else to explain the fact that he was empty and couldn't do anything for anyone. "I'm sorry."
"...Huh?" Twice blinked, "What... What for?"
Everything, Deku thought. From the fact that Twice thought that Deku was a good thing that happened to him to the fact that three of his fingers were broken.

Deku stared at him for a moment longer, and then looked down. He stared at the ground, and his mind spun. What was the right thing to say?
"...My name is Ojiro. Ojiro Mashirao."
Deku flinched, because he didn't realize that he had been referring to the taller man so informally. His face flushed in his embaressement.
The blond stared at him, and a smile came onto his face. Compared to Ojiro from before, who clutched Deku's bag to his chest and swore up and down that he could be useful, the Ojiro looked more comfortable in his skin. It stole Deku's breath away, and the resulting relief that flooded his heart made his eyes water. 
Thank god, he thought. Ojiro had become someone that could meet his gaze so evenly now. 
And then the shame came. While Ojiro was working on recovering, what had Deku been working on? Did Deku have anything to show for? When he did, would that be the right time to introduce himself as a person to him?
"I didn't really get a chance to say it earlier," Ojiro said, shifting a little in front of him. He gave a full bow, bending at his waist, and Deku flinched backwards, "but thank you for saving me. I'm really glad that I'm alive."
Ojiro picked his head up, a smile on his face until he saw Deku and his face fell. That made more sense, did Ojiro realize that he was talking to the wrong person? He didn't know how anyone could mix him up with Hawks or Eraserhead or Present Mic, but mistakes happened. They could make for a funny story so he-
"Are you okay?"
Deku stared back and looked behind him, was someone hurt? 
"Deku," Ojiro's voice called his attention back, "You're crying."
Deku's hand came up to his face. And indeed, there was water flowing down his face. He sniffled loudly, and then coughed, as though now that he realized what he was doing, he was feeling it in full force. Stupid, right? Strange, isn't it? Deku had never been good at anything, and he supposed that this was one more thing he couldn't do right.
Scrubbing at his eyes, he looked at Ojiro, the way he filled out his clothes and how tall he stood, his tail wrapped around his waist, and he bowed back.
"Sorry," he said, the word coming out croaked. "I'm-" but he knew he needed to at least say it, that Ojiro needed to hear it, and he coughed again, "I'm sorry."
Insincere. If he were Ojiro, he would think that Deku was insincere. His hand trembled and the world closed in. 
"I'm-"
A warm hand took his.
His head snapped up, and Ojiro took his hands.
"I didn't say it to make you feel bad," he said, squeezing Deku's hand in his. 
It was as gentle as it was warm, and Deku felt like something was scraping against his heart, hollowing it out by chipping at it, and Deku's body trembled as though he couldn't withstand the onslaught of his words. 
"I just wanted to let you know. That I'm thankful for what you did for me."
And Deku, who felt like he was taking credit where credit wasn't due, because Ojiro pulled himself back up onto his own feet and Ojiro was the one that learned how to smile again, shook his head.
"I didn't..." he rasped out, pulling away from the warmth and the kindness before he started to delude himself. He took a step back, "I haven't done anything."
His stomach churned, and he covered his mouth.
And Deku, who never ran from a fight, turned tail and sprinted away. He needed to go. He needed to get away. 
He didn't even realize where he was, behind one of the houses, until he realized that he was puking in someone's dead rose garden. 
Expectations, he thought to himself, were a heavy burden.
