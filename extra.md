### SAT
>> of uncertain victories

Izuku took a deep breath. He wouldn’t know for certain until he got a chance to look around himself, but there were no more monsters for the moment. He needed to figure out why there were so many monsters congregatd, if they were brought here or if they had holed up here before something awful happened to them. He couldn't even tell which ones used to be humans and which were always monsters. 
He looked up, where he could see the red feathers whizzing through the air. Loud clanging noises echoed out. Rolling his shoulder twice, he bounced on the balls of his feet. His body still moved to a satisfying degree. Break time was over.
He chucked his bat (and if it was bent at 90 degrees, was it really a bat anymore?) at one of the glass walkways on the second floor. With the help of his quirk (it was okay to call it his quirk now, right?), the walkway shattered and a substantial chunk of the monsters fell through.
He hummed a little, watching the way they piled over each other before they came crawling for him. It reminded him of a flashflood, but it was chunks of flesh instead of water. The ones a floor above all but jumped down. He frowned, because that wasn’t normal monster behavior. Normally, they just go for the closest options, but here they were, gunning for him. 
Well, he supposed it was a good thing, because he hated it when they made him hunt them down. If he could figure out why they did that, it would make his future a lot smoother. 
His thoughts trailed back to the store that Eraserhead was thrown into as the springing monster made contact. He crouched down and shot up as the first monsters came sprinting for him. Sending his knee right into the nose of one of the monsters, it crunched and splattered as his kneecap sunk into its face by a few inches. He swung his other hand over its shoulders and snapped its head backwards, a maneuver he wouldn't have been able to do without this quirk. 
That springer monster came crawling back to him, and tore like rice paper when Izuku's fist came to meet it. Without their speed and the element of surprise, they weren't anything special. More pressing, Eraserhead still hadn’t come out. Was he dead? The faster they cleaned this up, the better. Hopefully, Eraserhead was alive, and his body was completely intact. Then, they could all go home. Still, since Eraserhead (and from the looks of it, Hawks and one other person) were here, it was safe to assume that Spinner made it out, right? 
If Eraserhead didn't come back with us, would that meant that they only lost one person? If everyone thought he was still Helmet, he wondered if he would still be alive. 
He supposed he’d have an answer soon enough. 
He dodged a swing, stepping to the side and countered it easily. The head splattered as his fist shattered the skull through the front and then through the back. Chunks of its flesh rolled down his hand, and smeared it on the inside of the next monster that came for him. 
“Yo, Izuku!” Hawks came down like an angel looking for vengeance. His eyes were bright, features almost glowing as he gave a big grin at him. His hair was slightly tousled, like the wind had ruffled it playfully, and Izuku felt like the man just came off a poster. Wide wings sent feathers to slice across necks, decapitating them nearly instantly. “Back-up is here!”
In a few seconds, Stain dropped down with three other monsters, killing them on the way down and then using the bodies to cushion his fall. As effecient as he was deadly, and falling in free-fall, still didn't have any wasted movements. 
“I killed 23 upstairs,” he reported.
“I got 16,” Hawks added.
Izuku nodded, keeping count in his head. They were almost at 70. Judging from the fact that the monsters were no longer streaming out, he supposed that the number would stagnate some now. It doesn’t sound like there were hundreds, at the very least. Then the majority of the lesser monsters were dead. Hopefully, that meant that the fight would get easier. 
He looked around. Just under 20. His body was trembling, like he undergoing body aches or growing pains. Even though his mind knew to be alert, because this was where the fight would begin, his body trembled. 
Fighting long battles with this quirk was hard. 
-
“It’s finally slowing down,” Gang Orca said, panting hard. He grabbed one of his water bottles and emptied it over his head. Working with Dabi was tough, if only because he was constantly in danger of drying out. 
However, he wouldn’t deny that Dabi had some precise control over his flame. With a fire that burned so brightly it was blue, it was a magical wonder that this entire mall hadn’t burnt down to a crisp yet. More importantly, Gang Orca had yet to receive a single burn. 
Logically it made sense. Trying to fight in an unfamiliar location was substantially easier when there was someone to fight with. At the same time, he was pleasantly surprised that Dabi wasn't planning on hurting him, accident or otherwise. 
Next to him, bent over his knees, sweat dripping down his face, was Dabi. No doubt, the young man wasn’t used to long battles. From where he stood, he could already see how there were fresh burns coating his features, and otherwise uninjured. Even though they never had to team-up like this before, they made it through that ardurous battle without major injuries. 
Now, they had to keep up the pace and make it out of there with everyone else. 
“Now, don’t let me keep you,” Dabi panted out, straightening out even as his chest heaved. “Let’s go.”
The ability for him to continue pushing himself, even as he fell apart was admirable. In another time, at another place, Gang Orca thought that Dabi would have made a great hero.
“You would have made a good hero,” he said, too tired for his brain-to-mouth filter to work properly.
The younger man snorted, “You trying to insult me, fish?”
Gang Orca knew men like this. People who spoke harshly but never hesitated to ruin themselves to save the people in front of them. Growing up, he admired several. He was glad that they weren't all gone. 
“Never,” the former-pro said. “Just an observation.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Dabi wiped the bottom at the bottom of his chin, “I didn’t save you because I wanted to. You just happened to survive. That’s it. I don’t want Izuku to think that I’m so weak I can’t keep some hero-complex fish alive.”
"So, you did it for someone else?” Gang Orca teased. 
Blue eyes narrowed at him and he looked away.
“Heroes,” he scowled. “Always good at spinning words to suit their needs.” 
It was a lonely thought to have, as they stood in the shambled mess of what used to be a store. Helping kids like Dabi, who weren’t unsavable and afflicted with more lonely than their hearts could take, was what Gang Orca used to fight so hard for everyday. 
Something shuffled, crashing into several mannequins, and Gang Orca took a step in front of Dabi.
“Incoming!”
“Great…”
If saving someone was all it took to be a hero, Gang Orca wondered what that made people like Izuku, who inspired other people to ‘keep each other alive’ when they wouldn't have before. There was a word to describe it, but the relentless combat was starting to fray his thoughts.  
-
Stain pulled his blade out of the body in front of him. He checked the cracked blade and swung it around. Just from the swing, the top half of the blade slid off with a clink. Looks like he would be using glass shards for the rest of the battle. He turned around and saw Hawks looking around the room, his feathers still flying about the room. However, all the bodies on the ground remained there. 
“I’ll check the rest of the stores-” his voice trailed off when Izuku ran right past him and towards the store.
He whipped around, so confused that he lost his words for a moment. 
“Is something there?” the blond asked. 
“Eraserhead,” Stain replied back, “He got hit by that stretchy one.”
Hawks thought about that insanely long thing that shot out, something so fast that even he was caught off-guard, and grimaced. In an instant, he was past Izuku and in the store. When looking for someone, two hands were always better than one. 
In some corner of his heart, he found relief that Izuku had sprinted to see if Eraserhead was alive. That had to count for something, right?
“Eraserhead!” Hawks called out, his voice ringing in the store, “You alive?!”
Stain, watching their back as they backed into the store, remained at the entrance way of the store. Pensive eyes looked at the inside of the mall, keeping guard against any monsters that thought they would be easy picking now. 
The store was a mess of glass and pieces of furniture. Broken racks and wrecked tiles decorated the silent place. Associating so much danger with such silent serenity made it even more strange. The blond grimaced when he caught sight of the man. He eyed him carefully, and cautiously picked him up with his feathers. He had a pulse. He was breathing. 
“Hey, Eraser, can you hear me?” he asked.
“Hard to… sleep with all this noise,” the older man grouched out. A painful gasp came from his lips as he tried to sit up. 
“Whoa, easy there,” Hawks said, relieved that he was alive and of decent mind. His eyes surveyed the damage. He wasn’t a doctor, but even he could tell from how bones were protruding out and his uneven breathing that, “You’re not in any condition to fight.”
Eraserhead’s eyebrows furrowed, and between labored breaths, muttered out, “Some back-up.”
Quiet steps came up next to them. The blond took a moment to look at Izuku before turning back to Eraserhead. His feathers cleaned out a small area on the ground easily, and he propped the man up against the wall. Breaking out his first-aid kit, he worked quickly. He wasn’t a doctor, but he knew the basics from a career of heroics.
“Why did you come?” Izuku asked, breaking the quiet. 
The man slowly looked up. For a man who couldn’t stand by himself at the moment, his eyes were bright.
“We heard you asked for back-up,” he explained. 
“But why did you come?”
His face twisted into confusion, and Hawks wished that someone had to be injured for Izuku to speak up. 
Eraserhead took a few deep breaths, and answered slowly, like he was ashamed. Seeing one of his peers, someone who managed to keep a hold of himself even as the world came crumbling down, made Hawks grit his teeth in frustration. Was there a point to this?
He opened his mouth, ready to chastise the young omega for his terrible timing, but Aizawa spoke first.
“I came because I wanted to be helpful to you.”
Izuku stared at him for a moment longer and then sighed, like this whole thing was just a pain in the ass. Privately, Hawks wondered what the answer he wanted to hear was. 
“You weren’t,” he replied back bluntly. 
His expression didn’t change, and his gaze didn’t budge from Eraserhead. And suddenly, Hawks realized that Izuku wasn’t making any expression. He wasn’t angry or frustrated, and he hadn’t bared his teeth at anyone either. For the first time since he woke up without his helmet, Izuku looked at them without any hint of anger. 
“And now?”
Eraserhead paused, and realizing the same thing that Hawks did, spoke clearly.
“If there’s something I can do for you,” he said, with so much conviction that it shook his voice, “I’ll do it.”
Izuku nodded. For a second, it looked like he was going to leave, just leave the two of them there and walk away. Instead, he spoke quietly.“The generator,” he said. “Kickstart it.”
Eraserhead, getting off the ground, nodded. Basic first-aid was done, but he really should be heading back instead of jumping in further into the fight. “Understood.”
“What do you want me to do?” Stain asked, suddenly appearing inside of the store where they were.
Green eyes looked at the ground and then back up. No one would be able to tell if he couldn’t find the words that he wanted to say or if he didn’t want to speak at all. Thinking back to when Izuku was Helmet, silent and constantly on the move, it felt like a miracle that he said anything at all.
“Generator,” Izuku repeated. 
It was enough. Stain straightened, looking more human in that moment than any other time Hawks had seen him.
“Understood.”
And even though Stain frowned whenever he saw a former-hero, he fell into step with the limping Eraserhead and headed out of the store.
“Me?” Hawks pointed at himself, “Any plans for me?”
Izuku side-eyed him, and the blond wondered what the difference between the three of them were, that he didn’t say anything. He had a general idea, based off of the things that Izuku did before. Kill all the monsters, save all the people, secure any supplies they could, things like that. If Izuku was trying to get the generator on, he was probably going to 1) blow something up, 2) entice more monsters in the area here to destroy them all, or 3) was looking for information on something, and the monsters needed to die before that.
Either way, it boiled down to killing monsters. 
With Izuku’s eyes so focused, Hawks had no doubts. 
Izuku mercilessly killed the monsters, but he didn’t hate them. It made his stomach lurch as he wondered what the hell they were to him. Izuku looked at them with nothing but unbridled anger. He would ask, but he didn’t think that Izuku would answer him.
And he didn’t know if he wanted the answer to it.
-
“Jeanist!”
“Hawks!”
Distant sounds of explosion occurred in the far background. A splash of bright colors occasionally reflected off the remains of the wall, and informed them that some of the others were alive and fighting for their lives. 
And somehow, Best Jeanist managed to find someone in the middle of one of the clothing stores. Surrounded by the destroyed remains of children’s clothing, he reunited with a panting Hawks. Goggles broken and his hair sticking up in a mess all around his head, Best Jeanist was just glad that the man was alive.
“Good seeing you,” the taller man said, “Report.”
“I saw him just a second ago,” Hawks said, looking left to right, before he focused back on the fight in front of him. With several feathers flying out to pierce through the skull of wandering monsters, he grimaced when they twitched and started to stand up again. “Izuku sent Eraserhead and Stain to the generator, we gotta clean up everything else.”
They stopped talking for a moment. Best Jeanist pulling several threads to tie up a monster before he took the rifle out. With a deep breath, he aimed carefully and shot. When he took a step back, Hawks covered for him easily.
“Good to know that there’s a plan,” Best Jeanist replied back, throwing one monster into another before he took a step back to aim and fire. His heart stuttered when the body blew to bits because of his bullet, but he buried his hurt for later.
“God, it’s endless,” Hawks hissed. “There’s a few other types,” he continued. “They’re fast and long. They stretch out and shoot their whole body out. Not as fast as me, but you don’t hear them till they’re moving.”
The older man grimaced.
“What about the thing that has a lot of black sludge?”
Hawks froze. His head whipped over. “What?”
“There was a lot of black sludge-like substance outside when Endeavor-san and I made it in,” he explained. “It was coating the top of the mall, like it was spilling over or something.” Done reloading, he took aim as Hawks incapitated two more. “There’s something wrong,” Best Jeanist said, taking a moment to stare at the former hero. “This many monsters but we didn’t even notice? No one picked up on it?”
The winged-hero grinded his teeth down. 
According to Izuku’s incredibly detailed notes, it was uncommon for mutated monsters to bunker down with each other. Most regular monsters don’t associate with the mutated ones either. These were all things that kept to each other. It was unclear if it was a naturally-occurring phenomenon, or they were territorial. 
Monsters, two different types of mutants that they’ve never met before, and one of them wasn’t even identifiable. Their day was just getting better and better.
“Alright,” Hawks said, “Three types of monsters. Great.”
Pausing shooting for a moment, Best Jeanist took a few threads and yanked some of the monsters to the other side of the store. While he always knew that he could use his threads for this kind of violence, he’s never liked doing it. The sound of their necks snapping, even if they were monsters coming for his life, echoed in his heart.
On the other side, Hawks was still looking for Izuku. They were together just a second ago. He needed to know about the sludge. Suddenly, his eyes caught on something else.
“...What’s that sound?” he asked.
Another monster-type that they had never seen before came barreling through the store. Crushing the mannequins and display shelves like they weren’t even there, it came stomping and roaring at them.
“Shit-”
“What-”
The worst part was that it seemed to have a dorsal fin that was stuck in the ceiling. As a result, when it ran towards them, the tiles of the ceiling and lights shattered like flowers against a truck. Glass shattered, and dust rose. That said nothing about the monsters that continued to crawl towards them like possessed dolls.
Without a shred of hesitation, Hawks’ feathers got Best Jeanist out. When he tried to follow, seven monsters surged to the place where he was going to dodge. Gritting his teeth, he pulled his feather to hack at them, until he saw it.
In the corner of his eye, a dark surface shined before something sling-shotted at him. If he dodged, it would get straight to Best Jeanist. If he didn’t dodge…
Hawks knew exactly how much pain he could handle.
-
“Endeavor-san!”
Endeavor stepped back from the charred mess of monsters around him. He raised his hand as Eraserhead came limping towards him, Stain just a few feet from him. It was an unlikely duo, but he supposed that they had their reasons.
It would be better than suddenly being alone.
“The parking lot is clear, but there’s something encroaching,” the man immediately explained. “What about the others?”
“Izuku said to kickstart the generator,” Eraserhead reported.
“...Izuku said that?” the older man asked.
He nodded back.
“I see.” Endeavor turned around. He knew he saw a boiler room around here somewhere. “Then it will happen. When we kickstart it, we can make an announcement.”
Stain’s eyes looked from Endeavor to Eraserhead and then back again. And then he turned around, eyeing how quiet the stores had gotten.
Distantly, they could hear the others fighting. Broken glass being crushed under weight and the shrill sounds of screaming monsters from the other side of the mall. 
“...Is there something else wrong?” he asked.
“...Talk while moving,” he said, “We’re not alone.”
“The boiler room is this way,” Endeavor said, leading the way. 
Eraserhead, despite his limp, moved well. Stain held the back, and Endeavor lit the path they were talking.
“What was outside?” Stain asked.
“Some…. Black liquid-like substance. It kept encroaching closer as the sun went down,” the former hero replied back. “It gave me a bad feeling.”
In the silence of the fractured mall, their footsteps echoed. 
-
“Hawks!” Jeanist shouted, “Hawks, stay with me!”
Going from fighting back-to-back with someone, to fighting alone with someone bleeding on the ground was the opposite of what Best Jeanist needed to deal with. The springing monster that Hawks mentioned briefly had tackled Hawks into the bulldozer of a monster. 
Best Jeanist was just able to yank Hawks back towards him before the monster could do more than smack him once. But blood was oozing out of Hawks’ head and the man was unconscious. 
Several chattering sounds echoed around him, reminding him that he was alone, surrounded on all sides. Monsters and mutants alike curled in closer. He eyed the exit. It was beyond the Bulldozer and the Springer. 
And Hawks was unconscious.
Right before he could lose hope, however, a bent metal bat came swinging out. It smashed into the head of the mutant, cracking into its skull with a wet noise. When Best Jeanist whipped around to see what was going on, he saw that several monsters laid wasted on the ground.
Armed with a bat, Izuku stood. Blood dribbled down his neck as he held the top half of one of the monster’s head in his hand. He had clearly been engaged in a fight of his own before he came this way. Even from where he was, Best Jeanist could smell the blood off of him and felt nauseous to his stomach.
Izuku looked so young, he thought to himself. It felt wrong to see him splattered in blood like that. 
Dropping the head on the ground, Izuku flicked his hand to get the stray drops of blood off his hand as he stepped up next to Best Jeanist. 
“Izu...ku-chan,” he whispered out, awe and despair mixing all in one. How could he sit there so uselessly when an omega was getting up to fight? How could he just stand there and wait to be saved by someone caked in blood?
His yellow hoodie was missing a sleeve and was coated in black blood. Pulling the bat up, he stared at the monsters ahead. 
Before any words could be exchanged, the bulldozer monster wailed. The sound echoed through the store, almost bursting their eardrums. Several of the monsters immediately ran away, including the Springer that shot out back into the center of the mall, completely ignoring them. 
Briefly, Best Jeanist wondered if they didn’t get along together after all, but they were under an agreement of sorts. It was clear that they were still afraid of each other.
Izuku shifted the balance on his feet twice before he shot off forward to engage in combat. The monster, frightfully fast for its size, swung low at Izuku. The young man jumped up to avoid the hit and swung his bat. With strength like All Might, the frontal face of the Bulldozer was crushed like a cracker. The young man jumped backwards, reorienting himself with his eyes on the monster.
Another scream came out, a wet sound, but Izuku wasted no time. He rushed back forward, jumping up to land a clean head strike. Something next to him moved, but this time, Best Jeanist was ready.
Launching several of the mannequin pieces at the Springer coming for Izuku, he yelled out.
“Leave this to me!”
It was nearly shameful how out-of-touch he was with his own quirk. Even now, he was trying to recover back the skills he used to have, after nearly eight months of being unable to use it. However, it wasn’t an excuse. Failure wasn’t an option.
There was something here he wanted to protect.
The Springer was tough, but once it was caught off-guard, it was simple to catch. The ground shook just the slightest bit when the Bulldozer fell to the ground. 
As Izuku finished up with the Bulldozer, he rushed to kill the Springer. A single swing had its head splattering out like a tomato. The young man looked around, as though searching for the next monster, before he rushed back to Best Jeanist and Hawks. The closer he came, the stronger the stench of blood became. 
Best Jeanist looked from the bodies to Izuku, trying to contain the contents of his stomach. The reality of the situation was kicking in, now with Izuku in the frame. It was one thing to see dead bodies, it was another thing to see someone die, and it was a whole other thing to watch someone who barely came up to his chest kill someone-saving him in the process. Some of his colleagues had children bigger than him.
"Izu-"
"Hawks," Izuku cut him off, his voice firm. The young man lifted the head of the former pro-hero.
The man, with blood dribbling down his face, his shirt ripped, and feathers scattered all about, looked strangely peaceful. Amidst a battlefield like this, there was nothing more terrifying than that kind of serenity.
Still, Izuku carried himself with an equally terrifying amount of calmness. Truly, it was like he was the eye of a hurricane. He tore off his gloves and with his wrist exposed, he brought it up to Hawks' nose, as his other hand cupped the back of the blond's head.
"Easy," he said quietly. "Come back to me."
And then, at the center of a battlefield, with a dead body still warm just a few feet away, Best Jeanist smelled something absolutely mouthwatering. For a brief second, he felt his entire brain process stop. Something primal that hadn't been tampered with in a long while rose up inside of him. All of his instinct came to a single focal point and he slowly turned to Izuku.
He knew, everyone knew, that the young man was an omega. But he hadn't smelled him (or anyone, really) like this, so suddenly and strongly, strong enough that he could feel his vision narrow and his fangs sharpen in his mouth. A bone-deep hunger stirred, and he could feel the change in the air.
After confronting death, he wanted something about life. It was basal. It was primal.
It was delicious.
He watched Hawks' eyes slowly open, pupils like slits in his eyes as his jaw relaxed. His lips dragged across the inside of Izuku's wrist, inviting Hakamata's rage, because how dare this Alpha try on the Omega that would be His-
And Izuku brought his hand back and slapped Hawks across his face.
Like a bucket of cold water, Best Jeanist felt himself return. Immediately, he felt shame, and an equal amount of shock. The situation clarified the haze that had fallen over him. The burning desire didn’t subside completely, but it was no longer at the focus of his brain.
With a groan, Hawks sat up.
"That... was a wake-up call," the blond said, rubbing his cheek as the exhaustion stretched his features. 
Izuku pulled his sleeve down, pulled his glove back on, and with his dirty gloves, smeared dirt and drying blood all over Hawks' face. The older man spluttered, but otherwise didn’t fight the touch. Carefully, small hands moved the man's face left and right, green eyes looking over his features before he pulled back.
"How many?" he asked, lifting up three fingers.
"Three fingers," Hawks said before he worked his jaw. "God, you hit hard."
Izuku nodded, satisfied and he stood up.
"Get out of here if you're going to get in the way," he said, frigid in his words and expression. The blond winced in return. Green eyes slid to Best Jeanist, his disgust so apparent that Best Jeanist flinched.
Without another word, Izuku stepped back. He leaned down, picking up one of the glass shards.
"The exit is that way," he said, pointing opposite to where he was going.
"What about you?" Best Jeanist asked, even though it was plenty obvious.
The look Izuku shot him this look of thinly veiled contempt and exhausted rage like he couldn't believe that Best Jeanist was still alive. It was, at once, humbling and shameful.
“Someone has to go kill them.”
"You can't go alone," Hawks said, getting up to his feet. He swayed a little. "And I won't get in your way again."
Or at least, Hawks would have said when another massive monster came sprinting through the wall and furniture. Izuku’s eyes barely followed, and instead of doing the sensible thing of moving out of the way, shoved Hawks into Best Jeanist and out of the way. As a result, one of the Springers came and tackled Izuku through this store and into the next one by opening another hole in the store, leaving Best Jeanist and Hawks to deal with another huge monster. 
"Izuku-"
Hawks' feathers fluttered as the monster had brought several more for them to deal with.
Out of habit, Hawks reached for his commlink, like this was a mission gone wrong instead of a battlefield that they were ill-prepared for. His fingers came to nothing, since there was no commlink, and there was no backup, and no incoming or outgoing information because they were one of the last people that were alive in this region of Japan.
The two blonds immediately stood back to back.
First thing was to evacuate. Second was to mitigate damage. Third was to win as fast as possible. Somewhere behind them, where Izuku was taken to, something exploded. No doubt, Izuku would be handling his own fights.
Best Jeanist and Hawks were out of practice, but they used to stand at the top of the billboards. There was a reason why. 
“Alright,” Hawks said, “Round two.”
“Indeed,” Best Jeanist agreed. “This is only just the beginning.”
-
“There!” Endeavor shouted. He fired a shot of fire, careful not to start a fire that would bring the whole mall down on them. He hated fighting indoors for this reason, but he wasn’t Number Two for nothing.
The light shined and reflected off of Stain’s blade in an instant before the man slit the throat of the monster coming from the other side of Eraserhead. Still far from being useless, Eraserhead swung his capture scarf, swinging one monster into another before Endeavor shot through both of them with a blast of fire. 
“...What is that?” Eraserhead asked, narrowed-eyed, until Endeavor grabbed him and yanked them backwards. In a second, there was a wall of fire between them that quickly died down.
“That… is what we saw outside,” Endeavor said.
The group stared at the door with the ‘boiler room’ label, black sludge poured from the cracks in the doorway, and briefly, it looked like it was pulsing as it spilled out. Like drool, it oozed out slowly and the three backed away.
There was a small puddle forming at the ground.
“Izuku said to kickstart the generator,” Stain said, stepping forward, “We’ll figure it out.”
Endeavor worked his jaw and lifted his arm. “Stay back.”
The generator, and everything in the boiler room, was already lost. This would just be one more regret that Endeavor would hold in his heart. 

-
Why did it take so long to get the lights on? 
He should have gone and done it himself. He supposed that he got what he deserved, for trusting a bunch of alphas. Of course they wouldn’t follow his directions. They were probably biologically incapable of taking him seriously. 
He gave a sight. Stupid, stupid, stupid Izuku. 
Izuku lost himself for a moment, and it was a moment too much. The Springer on the left slammed right into him, sending the both of them crashing through the glass remains of one of the windows. 
If he didn’t focus, his life would be forfeit.
Grabbing a stray glass bit, he fell into old habits. Driving the glass shard into the eye of the monster, he grabbed its chin, and as though responding to his desperate body, an inhumane amount of strength surfaced and it’s head snapped off. Muscles, bone and skin tore into bits and it dropped on the ground like a broken puppet. Blood pooled at his feet. 
He did that?
Even now, the strength that filled his arms surprised him. 
He turned to the rest of the monsters. Were they shocked? Well, he supposed it didn’t matter. He wasn’t going to let a single one of them get away. Their shock would be the last thing that they felt, if they didn’t feel the pain of heavy blunt damage. 
Power thrummed under his skin. With one last exhale, he sprinted into action. He just needed to hold out until the lights came on. Once light shined, it would be easier to hunt down the rest of them. And then he would burn this entire mall down. 
There was something wrong here. He was certain of it. There were too many different types of mutants here. That was never a good sign. This kind of congregation was dangerous. Just thinking about them, smart enough to coordinate and cohabitate, made his stomach clench with anxious energy. 
Blood stained up to his elbows as he finished up. With the monsters crawling out and about, it was amazing to think that there was still any left. He could feel his body tremble with exertion. Even for him, this was too much to deal with. An hour or so of near non-stop combat was making his focus fray. 
It felt like the monsters were coming out in waves. He couldn’t tell if something had organized them to fight and that’s why they were coming out like this instead of a swarm, or if there was something else going on. Regardless, it annoyed him to no end.
With breaks in between like this, he could feel how heavy his limbs were getting. At least, if he fought and killed everything in one go, he wouldn’t even feel if all his fingers broke until the battle was over and all that was left was shifting for supplies and IDs. His breaths came out in short puffs, and he scowled. 
Something shattered upstairs, and Izuku’s eyes looked for a pair of staircases. And then he felt stupid, because he had a quirk. And that quirk would make it so that he didn’t need stairs anymore. Gritting his teeth, he readied himself for the jump. 
Quickly, he reminded himself he needed to get used to this quirk quickly. 
As he crashed upstairs, his eyes caught the situation quickly. He barely managed to dodge when Dabi’s fire nearly licked his arm.
“Shit!” Dabi cursed as he jerked his arm backwards, “Where the hell did you come from?!”
His voice was ragged and his chest heaved. If Izuku was tired, Dabi was teetering on exhaustion. It would have been impossible to think that they could have predicted it, but it didn’t stop the annoyance from bubbling up inside of him.  
If they couldn’t keep up, why did they come? 
He threw some of the broken shards of glass at the monster encroaching on Dabi’s side. Was this his fault? Would Dabi blame him for getting in the way and causing him to break concentration? On one hand, it made sense, since it was Izuku that had carelessly jumped up.
However, Dabi always struck him as the type to burn anything and everything, allies or not. It was strange to think that he would chicken out now, of all times. 
Dropping to a roll, he dodged two more monsters trying to grab him. As he got to his feet, he launched up and smashed their faces in, one with his fist and then he swung his body to land a solid kick on the second one. He could feel the bones crunching at the point of contact, and he managed to yank his limbs out of their body in time to land properly. 
Or, perhaps he was even more tired than Izuku thought, and his quirk was starting to fail him. It was possible. 
“I’m fine!” Dabi yelled out, after Izuku took out several monsters for him, “Get the whale!”
Izuku turned back into the store where he could hear distinct shouting. He didn’t want to go. Not because he didn’t want to help Gang Orca, but because if he left now, it felt like he was being too obedient. He showed up, killed shit, and ran off to fight somewhere else because someone told him to?
It was petty. He was aware of that. It didn’t stop the thought from soaking in his brain. He clenched his jaw.
Don’t think about it, Izuku. The moment he became someone that picked his pride over someone else’s life would be the moment he turned into what he hated the most. Even though he repeated the words in his head, replayed that godawful memory in his mind, his legs felt heavy.
Still, he ran forward. 
-
“Endeavor-san!”
Yanking Endeavor, Stain and Eraserhead back by several feet, a rush of red came from above. Feathers blocked off the monsters that came seemingly from nowhere, and Endeavor tried to rasp something out, a greeting, a gratitude, a warning, but instead, he managed to wheeze.
No one would have ever guessed that the black liquid oozing out from the room was combustible. Needless to say, a wild vortex of fire had spread faster than the three of them could react, and robbed them of oxygen.
“You,” Stain said, barely catching his breath as he pointed at Endeavor, “I’m never partnering with you again.”
Aizawa gave a warbled noise, probably in agreement, as he slowly curled to the side.
“Glad you guys are alright,” Hawks said, his feathers bringing chunks of the drywall to give them temporary reprieve of the flamestorm. “Unfortunately, we’re just smoking out the rats.”
And as though fleeing from the fire, several monsters came crawling out of the closest stores. The fire encroached mercilessly, but the group of five were on their feet, ready for the fight.
“...Get to the exits and evacuate!” Endeavor shouted out, ignoring the sharp look Stain shot him for ordering him around,  “We’ll kill them as they escape!”
Hawks’ wings beat powerfully as his feathers came to the others.
“We’re heading out at my fastest then!”
-
There will be a time where someone cannot avoid getting hit. It was unfortunate. It was unavoidable. It was a possibility that they must be ready to face, and brace for impact accordingly. If all went well, damage would be minimal, and they would be able to finish the fight and make it back home alive.
It happened. It was normal. It was natural.
What was not normal was Izuku, who stepped away when someone came close, who slapped their concerned hands, and scowled at their worry. With a gaze so cold that it could freeze Endeavor in his place, and a glare that burned so bright that Kamui Woods stepped away, Izuku was the furthest thing that anyone would associate with ‘approachable’. 
That Izuku, face contorted in pain, jumped into the fight. Four new jagged lines that should have clawed across Gang Orca's side because he could not dodge this attack, embedded into Izuku's back before the two went flying to the side.
Gang Orca could hardly believe it. He looked at him, shocked and surprised and Izuku didn't spare him a second glance.
"W-Why-"
And Izuku rushed back into the fight. His tattered sweater flung in the breeze behind him, a bright red blooming across the faded yellow of ripped cotton.
And if there was a way to explain the amount of frustration and annoyance that Gang Orca felt inside of him, it would be the shape of Izuku in the shade of Not-Gang Orca's-Blood red.
Izuku took another careless blow to the head, knocked straight off his feet and went head-first into the ground. Just as fast, he swung his feet up and caught the monster in the chest, and managed to flip himself onto his feet. 
He wiped at his chin, eyes bright like they were glowing, and with herculean strength that looked odd coming from such a small body, Izuku surged forward, grabbed the monster and chucked him to the storefront. It sailed through the air before crashing into the ground and rolling the rest of the way out. 
A shock of blue flames came out, and when it died, the man came forward.
Not in the sense that Dabi was running towards them, but in the sense that it looked as thought Dabi had been chucked out of the center of the mall and into the store. Not even a second later, a blur of red appeared, and Hawks landed in front of them.
“One of the monsters combusted!” he shouted out, “And the fire is catching fast!”
“Sounds good to me,” Dabi grouched out, more than upset that he was being flown through by a bunch of feathers, “I’ll take you out while I’m out it.”
And Izuku stared at Hawks for a long moment before turning to Gang Orca. Could he get out of here by himself?
“Let’s go!” Hawks said, “there’s this black ooze. When it hits fire-” an explosion echoed from further in the mall, and the entire structure trembled, “it exploded. We don’t know where else it is. We need to go!”
But Izuku wasn’t done. There were enemies to keep fighting. There were bodies he didn’t confirm were dead. There was so much, and he hated how much that he just didn’t want to listen to him. He didn’t want to stop because someone else told him to.
“Izuku?”
But Hawks was an alpha who hadn’t tried to [Command] him. None of them did. Even though now was the perfect, textbook example of when an alpha should [Command] an omega, he didn’t.
His eyes, gold and earnest, beseeched him.
If he was lying, then he was a phenomenal liar. Or maybe Izuku was just stupid. Exhaustion piled onto him, and his head pounded. Did they kill everything? Did he manage that?
-
Had the news media, and the hero's association been around, they would have all been scorned to hell and probably on probation if their licenses weren't immediately revoked.
There wasn't much of the mall left behind. It was standing, but the center part that used to be all glass was gone, some of it being shaken out of Hawks' wings and some of it being pulled out of Gang Orca. The mall, itself, was burning. The captured monsters screaming and squealing within the crackling fire slowly turned silent. The fire vortex they managed to pull together burned brightly, probably melting whatever glass and smoking out the rest of the plaster and concrete.
And watching it burn at the front of their group was Izuku. He stared, expressionless and still as he watched the mall he ignited coat the entire skyline in smog. His sweater was hanging off of his shoulder, backless while the front was missing, and looking ready to just fall apart. A sleeve was torn off and bunched at his wrist, while the other one was fully missing. Between smears of dirt and ash, long cuts and swelling bruises decorated his skin like tattoos and jewelry.
Of all the people that came, however, he was in better shape. Aizawa couldn’t stand up on his own, and Gang Orca looked to be bedazzled by various glass bits. Endeavor and Dabi were almost bent over their knees, trying to catch their breath, but their body was too exhausted to even breath properly. Hawks and Best Jeanist, supporting several bruises and possibly some broken bones, favored one side over the other. Stain, who at initial glance looked to be unaffected, had burns coating where his clothes couldn’t cover. 
If society was still functional, they would have all been scorned to hell for letting an omega get so battered in battle. The amount of criticism that would rain down on them for losing the mall and returning so thrashed would echo on the news for days, and they would have become the laughingstock of the nation. They would have been stripped of the licenses or put on probation because no one would ever let them forget that they decimated this entire mall. It would have been the end of many of their careers.
Izuku turned around, with a painful-looking black eye and his split lip stretched into a grin. His eyes were bright, almost prideful and looked at them without contempt and disdain for the first time since he opened his eyes.
"We won," he said, his chest full of something he couldn’t explain. Blood continued to run freely from his forehead, dripping down his chin. Instead of an applause, however, the crackle of the fire and faint screaming was what greeted him.
Fitting for an omega, he supposed. 
"Izuku," Gang Orca said, quiet and stern as his eyes darted to his arm, just barely attached by bone and muscle, and then back to his face, "We need to get that looked at."
The older man came closer, and for once, Izuku didn't move away from another person. His smile remained, just as soft, just as gentle as snowfall. He gave this soft sigh, but from the look on his face, they realized that he was laughing. Probably. He could just be breathing hard, and catching his breath.
Izuku's eyes turned back to the mall, clear green eyes taking in the dying inferno in front of them.
Hawks stepped towards Izuku, ready to take this man back to base at his fastest. They could see the intensity of his focus as his eyes trained onto Izuku and his uneven breaths.
Green eyes slowly locked with his. With a gaze so gentle that it didn't feel like Izuku was the person in front of him, the blond struggled with himself.
"This time, we won,” Izuku repeated himself. 
He watched the smoke funnel out. As though listening to something soothing, he closed his eyes.
Hawks caught him before he teetered too far to one side, his expression tight when his arms wrapped around him and he realized how wet and sticky the young man was. The blood that formed a small puddle at his feet was a dark red.
"I'm taking him back," he said before he was gone in a gust of wind. While everyone was undoubtedly injured, head injuries took priority. 
“...He doesn’t hate us,” Best Jeanist said, and he sounded so shocked, so hopeful, that the others winced. 
“...He doesn't hate us right now,” Dabi amended, blue eyes trained on the burning mall.
It must be the fever. It must be the blood loss. The pain, the exhaustion, and the stress of the battle, as well as the relief that it ended in their victory. Whatever it was, something must have messed up Izuku's thought process. That made more sense.
It made more sense, but it wasn’t what they wanted to believe. 
“I’ll watch over this,” Endeavor said, “Head back.” He gave Gang Orca, Eraserhead, and Dabi a stern look. “Go back and get some medical attention.”
“I know without you telling me,” Dabi griped back. He turned back around, hand on his ribcage. He bared his teeth when Best Jeanist came closer, “Keep your hands to yourself.”
The blond sighed back, but did so reluctantly.
“I’ll keep an eye on him,” Eraserhead said, favoring one leg considerably more than the other.
“Leave it to me,” Gang Orca replied. “And for now, let’s just get back to base.”
Looking around, they realized that Stain was already gone. Figuring that he would figure it out for himself, the others focused on what was in front of them instead.
“Endeavor-san,” Best Jeanist tried, but lost his words in the palpable fury in Endeavor’s eyes.
“Go first,” he said. “I am more than enough for this.”
And understanding that this wasn’t just about the ashes, Best Jeanist did just that.
Victory tasted like blood.



### way back home [afterwards: ver Deku]

"...Why are they calling me Izuku?"
Takami's smile froze on his face, but he kept himself under control. 
"Isn't that your name?" he asked, keeping his voice light as he passed the plate of cut apples to him. He took one and munched on it. There was no reason to think so, but he hoped that Midoriya could see that there was someone that was willing to cut apples for him at the hospital. 
Midoriya stared at the plate of cut apples, "I've always been Deku," he said. "Useless, quirkless Deku."
His hands trembled as he held them in his hands.
"It feels like I'm the wrong body, living someone else's life," he said quietly. 
Takami could only imagine. Everything about Midoriya felt like an impossibility. From the different types of people he associated with to the incidents he always ended up in, Takami would have never thought that people like Midoriya could be real. 
"The person you cut this for," he said quietly, looking at the untouched plate of apples, "isn't here."
Takami chuckled. 
"I'm here to cut apples for a patient trying to recover," he said. "Community service, if you will. And while doing so, I met someone that I wanted to be friends with." He pushed the plate of apples towards him.
"Even... though I'm just Deku?"
The blond kept an amiable smile on his face, and swore to himself that he'd never let Midoriya think like that. 
"Nah, because you're Midoriya Deku."
His eyes watered, and he ducked his head. Covering his eyes with one hand, his chest trembled, but he didn't let out any sound. Takami wished that there was a way for him to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he would be here for him. That he would always be there for Midoriya.
Because he wanted to.

-

Midoriya trembled. He could hardly believe that this was the same Midoriya who so boldly told him to [come with me].
He flinched when a car drove by. His shoudlers were hunched and he ducked his head down so that his chin was permamently glued to his chest. Seeing him like this, thinking that, at some point in his life he was forced to be like this, made his chest boil.
"Hey," Shigaraki reached his hand out, "C'mon."
Midoriya flinched, eyes wide, and he stared at Shigaraki's hand for another, long moment.
And then, he turned around, as though to check if there was someone behind him, and Shigaraki wondered where his Izuku even came from.
"I'm talking to you, Deku," he said. "Take my hand so I don't get lost."
"W-What?"
"You know your way around here, right?" Shigaraki asked, "I don't. And I'm the type to stray so let's..." his face burned a little, but lying could be a good thing and he would do just about anything if it would make Midoriya sit up a little more. "...Let's hold hands."
He extended his hand to Midoriya.
Right when small hands reached for him (and scars that Midoriya used to hide so much weren't so well hidden. He still couldn't decide if it was a good thing that Midoriya wasn't good at hiding or angry beyond words that he was ever hurt in the first place), people around them started to point and whisper. 
His features paled and Shigaraki thought to a time, a long time ago, when he and Midoriya talked about heroes and villains. He could feel it. A tickling urge inside of him that called to bring down everyone that ever looked at Midoriya and thought that he was anything but the greatest. And if that meant ruining the world and crippling society, that was fine. 
"C'mon," he said, "Assist your elders."
And that brought a small smile on his lips.
"You're not that old," he said.
"Huh? But you're admitting that I am old?"
The young man flinched backwards, like he expected to be hit and Shigaraki swallowed his rage. Hand still extended out, he waited.
"Since now my feelings are hurt too, you'll take my hand, right?"
And Midoriya who never hesitated to make sure people weren't alone, tentatively took Shigaraki's hand. A shiver of delight ran down Shigaraki's spine, when Midoriya's lips curled into the small, shy smile. 
The rage that boiled his heart, as well as the surge of being relied on, were feelings that Shigaraki would have never experienced if Midoriya had never pulled him out of that dumpster. 
And he hoped that, the same way the smell of books now made him relax, Midoriya would take his hand without hesitation.
"I... I don't know where to go," Midoriya said quietly, "I don't... recognize any of these streets."
Shigaraki nodded back, "Since we're together, we're not lost," he said. He gave a crookcked grin, "We're on an adventure. C'mon, let's get some waffles." 
In his pocket, the phone that Midoriya bought him sat with a gps and map funciton, but he wanted this moment to stretch a little bit longer. 
But lying was a lot more fun than he thought. 

-

Chisaki knew, in his heart, that the Deku who used to eat udon with him wasn't here anymore. Instead, a timid boy with his face sat in front of him. They were not the same person.
Midoriya, who gently reminded Chisaki to eat his vegetables and taught him the wonders of dirty street vendor food, was pale-faced as he stared at the table in front of him. He went, white as a sheet, from the second Chisaki pulled his sleeves up and his tattoo shined under the light, and Chisaki wondered where this Midoriya was when they had first met.
What had happened, he wondered, between this and that Midoriya that the Midoriya he longed to see had come into existance?
Appetite gone, Chisaki wondered which stage of grief he was on. If he could finally move on from the curse that was [Midoriya Izuku] in his life. He closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose.
The sigh made the Midoriya in front of him flinch, and Chisaki didn't know that he still had room in his heart to be disappointed. 
"Could I... ask you a question?" he asked quietly.
"You already did," and then he mentally berated himself. Once upon a time, he would have jumped at the thought that Midoriya wanted to know more about him. They would have joked, would have laughed, and they would have learned more about each other and Chisaki wouldn't feel this achingly empty. He took a deep breath and shook those regrets out of his head. He felt like an idiot. "No, o ahead. Ask whatever you like."
His voice was quiet, so quiet that Chisaki would have missed his words if his body wasn't so trained to be so honed in on Midoriya's every last feature.
"Are you... okay?"
He paused, blinked.
"...What?"
The young man flushed, looking so familiar in a second that Chisaki's heart twisted in his chest, and he stared at the table.
"It's just... You're... yakuza, right? But you came alone, and you haven't demanded anything from me yet. So it can't be that you're here because you want something from me. I don't have anything to give you anyways. But you haven't walked out yet, so I must have done something to you, right? I don't know what I did, but I'm sorry for what I can't remember. I..." he placed his hand on his forehead and grimaced, like his head was throbbing, and Chisaki grabbed his wrist.
"Don't," he said. "Stop apologizing. I'm not here to hear you apologize."
"You're here for someone I'm not," he spoke so sharply that Chisaki tensed back, "For putting that look on your face, someone should apologize."
They had so many similarities. From the cautious way he inquired about his health to the way he peered up at him. The certainty of his voice when he explained that someone needed to take responsibility, and who else other that Midoriya would try to cover for something he had no control over? He could overlap the two and Chisaki wondered when he would be freed of those green eyes.
He came here, so certain that he would let go. That this wasn't His Midoriya and that he would be able to release this like a crazy, fever dream.
Instead, that blasted hope bloomed in his chest.
Midoriya lost his memories, but he didn't change at the core. Didn't that meanthat they could start over? And Chisaki could just give him beautiful memories. They could be happy.
Midoriya could choose him.
"I'm sorry I'm not him-"
"You haven't changed," Chisaki cut him off. "I would never be able to explain to you my gratitude that you are alive." And instead he did something that he didn't think that he was capable of. He dipped his head forward. "Midoriya, I'm truly glad that you're alive." He straightened up, "and since you have forgotten, allow me to remind you. My name is Chisaki Kai. I am your ally. At any point, you feel lost, you feel alone, you feel like you are not enough, I will be there for you."
"...But I'm not the person you think I am?"
Chisaki gave this laugh.
"I have found what I am looking for," he said. "Thank you for your time," he said. 
But the look of stunned shock made him feel victorious. It almost felt like, for the first time since they met, they were finally on the same playing field. 
He took a drink out of his tea, feeling like it wasn't as bitter as they usually made it.
"I have a question for you, if I may?"
And the kid in front of him, gnawing on his straw, gave a curt nod. "You already asked one."
At that, Chisaki gave a barking laugh. It was so loud that the other patrons in the store fell silent, and the man raised his hand at them to apologize. He covered his mouth and peered at Midoriya, saw Deku, and brightened.
"Yes, I suppose I did," he said when he finally managed to calm down, "May I ask some more?"
Shocked but not upset, Midoriya gave a curt nod. 
"Then," he hummed, golden eyes bright, "Could I ask why you decided to meet up with me today? You didn't look too eager."
There was a long silence, the other patrons returned to their quiet conversations, and Midoriya spoke up again. 
"I figured the faster that I disappointed you, the faster you would leave," he said. "And I..." he placed his hand over his heart, "I felt warm when I saw you."
"You know I'm a bad person, right?" Chisaki asked.
"I don't think there are any good or bad people in the world," Midoriya replied, "Just... people who hurt me and people who ignore me."
"Then, what am I to you?"
The young man gave this helpless little smile, "Chisaki-san?"
"Kai," he said, because the man he was [Overhaul] for wasn't here anymore. And until Midoriya remembered why he was [Overhaul], he'd have him call him something more intimate. 
And, since he was a bad person, he would take advantage of this. 

### sat

"You will never meet someone as gentle or as cold as him," Fuyumi said.
She stepped forward, her breath coming out in puffs by her lips as the ice coated the ground where she walked. Layers of ice laid on top of each other, each one colder and thicker than the one underneath it. They formed like sharp icicle parts, piercing through the air. The chill of death came, radiating off the ice. 
Izuku, who was merciless in his kills, often killed within a hit or less. Rei, who felt a bubbling rage from deep inside of her chest, could not claim to do the same. Not because she was particularly weak or a non-combative, but because she didn't want this man to leave the earth in such a peaceful, painless way.
This man, who whistled when their leader walked by, purred and preened and tried on several occasions to scent Izuku, did not deserve to pass away from Izuku's gentle hands. He would know fear and die praying for death. 
That, Fuyumi swore on the life Izuku saved her from.
Todorokis' know no mercy.

-

Her hands trembled. She did it. The thing that everyone, even little Kouta, had been doing since the start of all this. She had finally done it herself. Killing herself, with her quirk, was easy.
She, who had grown up wishing and praying that she was quirkless so that she would have one less thing connecting her to her family, had used her quirk to kill someone. In another time, this would have made her a vilain. A criminal. 
Here, it was normal. She was the strange one for not killing. 
And still-
A hand came to her face, and she jolted. She didn't even realize someone had come close, but her eyes found a pair of green eyes in front of her face. A small hand, calloused by hard work, cupped her face. 
Izuku.
The warmth from his hand reached from her face to her heart, thawing her out. She closed her eyes, desperately wishing that she could be worthy of this warmth. How nice would it be, if this warmth was the only thing in the world.
"...I'm... I'm okay," Fuyumi said, desperately trying to keep herself together. There was something else she needed to say. She needed to report. What, who, she killed. and her injuries. She wasn't injured. She needed to report it, because she wasn't useless. She wasn't just waiting for someone to save her. She wanted to do more than just stand by and wait for what to do and she wanted...
"Good work," Izuku spoke, his voice soft and his scent gentle. As though she wasn't shameful enough, Fuyumi felt her eyes prickle. She gave a heaving breath, her shoulders trembling. "Welcome back."
And even though it was improper and it was even more unbecoming of her, her arms wrapped around Deku. She gave a wet sob. 
What about now? Was she a little more worthy of standing next to him now? Was she worthy of his time and energy now? Was it okay that she was still alive? How much shit did Izuku have to constantly hear because he saved her? She didn't remember. 
Her hopes to be reliable seemed to fall apart, however, when small hands came to her back and rubbed circles.
Comfort wasn't the sweet smell of an unbonded omega that no longer hated her. Comfort was the smell of her leader, soaked in the blood of their enemies. 

-

[Captive: 1 man (beta) + 1 woman (beta)]
"I'm going to kill him!"
Shigaraki's voice rang in the room as he kicked the door down. Red eyes livid, he stormed into the room. Eyes immediately found the bastard that had left Kaminari in that sorry state, and he bared his teeth.
"Wait, Shigaraki!" Spinner called out, running in front of the man.
"Out of my way, Spinner!" 
But Shigaraki, who was spewing curses as he snarled and hissed, yelled out for the whole world to hear.
"Do you know what he did to Kaminari?! Did you see what he did!?" he yelled at Spinner before he turned back to their captive, "I'm going to fucking kill him!"
"No!" Spinner shouted back, grabbed Shigaraki around the middle and pushing him back. "No, you can't Shigaraki!"
"Why not!" he yelled back, "Why the fuck not!"
"Danna-sama isn't here!" the man yelled back, "Danna-sama said to keep them alive!"
At the mention of their Leader, Shigaraki stepped back, and Spinner released him. Red eyes remained trained on the stranger, lips pulled back into a deep scowl. 
"He doesn't deserve an easy way out," he spat out bitterly.
"Izuku-sama," Spinner spoke up, "Will decide that."
Shigaraki scowled, "Break his legs. At least four fingers. He doesn't need them to live."
"Is he still alive?"
The two alphas stared at each other for a moment longer before they both took a step back for the person who spoke.
Holding the door open was Endeavor, expression blank, and walking through was Izuku, arm in a sling. Shirtless with a jacket over his shoulders and thick bandages wrapping around his chest, Izuku's sweet smell immediately filled the room.
"Izuku-sama," Spinner bowed politely, and Shigaraki grumbled out some sort of greeting. Before Spinner could turn and lecture him about ettiquitte, however, Izuku brushed past them. 
He pulled a lanyard out of his sling, and dangled it.
"Wha..." the stranger peered up, no doubt stunned speechless that the Great Izuku-sama that the others spoke about was this whelp of an omega.
"What do you know about this?" he asked. 
And it was amazing, how fast a person's demeanor changed once they realized that Izuku was an omega. The man that curled in on hismelf and tried to press himself into the furthest corner of the room suddenly had this hope in his eyes. He straightened and looked at Izuku.
"You think that I'll just do whatever you want? Do you know who I am?" and the beta bared his teeth, "Know you're place!"
Which was laughable, because this little beta was severely outclassed by all three alphas in the room. 
"This little bitch-" Shigaraki's words were cut off when Izuku took a step back.
"He doesn't know anything," he said, "Do whatever you want with him."
Shigaraki's grin stretched across his face, "Anything?"
Izuku stared at him. "Kaminari can't walk on his own," he said, "Treat our guest with courtesy."
"W-Wait!" the man yelled out, "You want to know, don't you?! About that place! The pharmacy is a research center! I can tell you how to get there! D-Don't!" his eyes looked wildly between Shigaraki and the omega and then landed on Endeavor, "Endeavor-san! You're a hero! Save me!"
"Spinner, Shigaraki, good work keeping him alive all this time. Have some fun, alright?"
And Izuku walked out of the room, Endeavor left with him, never once looking back. 
Shigaraki turned to Spinner, "You wanna take the first shot?"
"Wait, wait, wait please!"
"I would be honored," the lizardman dipped his head, a grin crawling on his face as he pulled a dagger out. "We should make sure he's quiet first, right? So everyone else can rest?"
"Please, please forgive me!"
"Oh, I didn't even think about that," Shigaraki nodded, "Sounds good."
"I'll cooperate! I'll do whatever you want! I-"
"You know the problem with guys like you?" Spinner asked, "You're not even loyal to yourself. You really think that you can look at our leader like that and think that we'll let you off free? You think that you can get away with anything just because you apologized?"
The man stared up at them, all wide-eyed and fearful, and Spinner wondered how this guy managed to survive so long.

-

"Watch carefully," Izuku said, a bitter smile curling on his lips, "And find the the most opportune time to strike me down."
His throat tightened, never once expecting that he would redefine Justice in the world, and clutched his hands tightly. 
"I'm leaving the future to you."


### solo lvl

Midoriya stared at him, tilted his head, and then spoke.
"I don't have a spell for that," he said, "but I have a curse."
"A what?" Touya seemingly materialized next to him, "You can do what?"
"A hex, a curse, a debuff, whichever one you want," Midoriya replied back. He stared at Twice, "I can use [Silence]."
"...What's... the difference between the three?" Natsuo asked quietly.
Touya gave him this look, but Aizawa explained things.
"A debuff is the lightest of the three. They're usually time-locked and easiest to remove. When we enter a poison-fog and get afflicted with [poison], it's a temporary thing and only lasts a few seconds after we get out of the fog, or if someone can cast a debuff clear on us," he said. "A hex is the next step up. Concerning range and distance, it's a debuff on steroids. It's cancelled if the caster dies, or a stronger mage can break it."
He hesitated, looking at Midoriya and Midoriya spoke up.
"A curse will last past the lifetime of the Caster," he explained. "It latches onto the magic of the target. It will disappear when their magic does. It's the better option, since I can't always be next to him."
"And it also chips away at the life of the caster," Aizawa spoke up, eyes trained on Midoriya's figure.
The young man blinked at him, and smiled.
"Yes," he said. "It does."
"Then uh, don't worry about that then. // Shut this guy up!"
And Twice's hands came up to his head and shook his head.
"Shut up!" he yelled out, "Shut up! Izuku finally helped us! I'm not gonna take anything from him! // Keep speaking! I hate everyone anyways! Who cares if someone hurts-"
And his voice cut out when Midoriya's hands grabbed the back of Twice's hands. Peering up at him, green eyes met Twice's eyes, welling with frustrated tears. 
"Jin," he spoke quietly, "Do you trust me?"
The blond nodded, "but I don't wanna hurt you. // Unless you wanna get hurt."
Midoriya smiled back, looking as gentle as the petals on a flower. He tugged the taller man down a few more inches, and laid their foreheads against each other. The magic around them thickened, like a fog rolling in. A pale green lined the fog, and all the hunters in the vicinity shivered at the surge of magic that rose up. 
"Wait, Midoriya-"

"...Even his [curses] are beautiful," Natsuo said, breathless. As a tanker, he had been the target of more curses than the average hunter. And still, his heart pounded at the reminder of a curse so strong it could choke out most hunters, laid out so gently at their feet. 
"And you're sure you're okay?" Aizawa asked, eyes furrowed in their worry as he followed Midoriya into the room holding a blanket.
"I-I'm fine," Midoriya replied, "I can hold those-"
"Shouldn't you rest?" the man asked, a firm frown on his face, "Aren't curses supposed to be deliberating?" 
And Natsuo didn't blame him for thinking that. Normally, curses are a last ditch, horrific thing. Something that monsters casted on their assailant, usually, as a "I'm going to die and take you with me" thing. Usually taking lifespan and magic, it was am awful thing for both the caster and the target. 
But Midoriya's cheeks were blink as he gave a shy smile to the taller man. 
"I-I'm okay," he chirped out, "Thank you for being concernered."

-

"Where did you learn how to cast [curses]?" Touya asked quietly.
"I just... knew?" Midoriya shrugged back. 
"You've... never had it casted on you before?"
Midoriya shook his head.
The taller man stared at him for a long moment before he sighed. "Okay," he said, turning his attention to his lap. "Okay, let's keep it that way."

-

"Wait," Natsuo said, lifting his hand up, "We need a name for our Guild. Before we decide and do anything else, we need to decide on what we're going to call ourselves."
There was a long pause.
"...Deku," Midoriya said, "I think we should call it Deku."
"Deku?" Natsuo frowned.
"Yeah," Midoriya lifted his finger and traced the kanji out in the air. As he wrong, the magic pulsed in the air, and the words he wrote appeared in front of him, a thick, translucent green like someone wrote in green ink with a thick brush. The casual display of strength and ability, had them staring in shock. "Not 'useless' but a Deku that 'gives it his all'," he said. 
"Sounds like backstory," Twice said.

"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.
