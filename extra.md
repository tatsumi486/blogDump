There was a sudden notice. 
[Attention all availiable hunters, a gate-break has occured. All availiable personal should make their way to protect civilians and mitigate damage.]

And Natsuo groaned because if it was found out that they ignored this kind of summon, they would be in big trouble, would face some fines and probably experience a big delay in re-assessments. So, Natuso and Touya crawled out of bed in the wee hours of the morning to get dressed and headed out. 
"Where's Mustafuyu?" Touya asked, eyes looking over the notice as they packed into a train with several other mumbling and grumbling hunters.
"God, it's just Mustafuyu," one of the other hunters said.
"All this pain in the ass but we're not going to get anything out of it anyways."
Touya arched an eyebrow at his brother and waited for a response. 
"Uh... Oh, it was while you were gone," Natsuo replied, the reminder snapping the rest of his sleepiness away, "Uhm... It's pretty much a dead-zone. Since so many gate-breaks occured in the same area, people closed shop and moved out. It's just a ghosttown at this point."
Touya hummed, "I feel like I've heard it before."
"Uh... I know there was an ice cream place over there," Natsuo replied, "A long time ago, I think. We went there twice, I think. Like, in middle school?" 
His brother tilted his head, letting Natsuo know that he didn't remember it while Natsuo still remembered down to the color of their shoelaces as they took the train on a detour on the way home. He remembered, because for as cold and delicious as the ice cream was, he felt hollow and empty because no noticed or even cared that they were gone till the middle of the night. 
Well, it wasn't that great of a memory. It was probably better that Touya forgot it or was too tired to remember it properly.
"You think Midoriya will be there?" Natsuo asked.
"They're blaring it on all screens and having sirens everywhere," Touya replied, but the smile was starting to stretch his lips, "I'd be shocked if he didn't get the notice."
"Yeah," Natsuo laughed, "That's true."
Gate-Breaks werea big deal, if they happened anywhere that wasn't a dead-zone. And even then, it was a relief that it was Mustafuyu, since that meant that there was some time before someone else had to go in and close the gates and nothing really worthwhile would break in the meantime. In an easy mood, because broken gates were just easy money for any hunter fast enough, Natsuo and Touya and every Hunter making their way over to Mutsafuyu. 
However, the fact that all availiable hunters were being called meant that it had to be a C-Rank or something that broke. Usually, the association took care of everything lower. 
Instead, Touya's head suddenly snapped up, and right when Natsuo was going to ask if he needed to use the restroom, he felt it.
Midoriya's magic.
And that dread started to really make a home inside of Natsuo's gut.


"I didn't want to get adopted," Midoriya said, "and if your face is sorta," he made a motion at the black-eye, "people think you're trouble so they won't get you."
He looked forward.
"And after a while, it stopped hurting so I guess I just..." he stared at his hands, "stopped noticing." He gave a breathless laugh, "When you asked me, 'why do you live like this?' I couldn't believe it. I had totally forgot that I didn't need to live like this," he turned to Touya and Natsuo, tears filling his eyes, "thank you," he said. He gave this laugh, tears starting to stream down his face. "I have a party. I'm not alone."
Touya ran over, his arms wrapping around Midoriya's shoulders and pulled him close. His hand came to cup and hold Midoriya's head against his chest, and Natsuo pulled his eyes away, feeling as though he was intruding on something. He rubbed at his eyes, willing the tears and everything away.
But Midoriya, who fought his own wars alone and alone and alone, was crying. A cry that clawed at Natsuo's chest shredded through the air, and he covered his eyes and squeezed the bridge of his nose.
"Thank you," Midoriya cried. "Thank you. Thank you." 
Natsuo rubbed at his eyes, the heavy realization that Midoriya finally saw them as a party threatening to split his heart into two. 

-

"Your... Your ears are pierced."
And if Midoriya had just the earlobes pierced, Natsuo would have said that it was cute. So fucking cute and Natsuo would have considered getting his ears pierced so that they could match or something. 
Midoriya nodded his head. Tilting his head, he showed off four helix piercings around the top and middle of his small ear, and an earlobe piercing. All of which were adorned with different gems of various colors and were a mix of different sizes as well. Natsuo, who didn't think that he was very fasion-literate, balked at them. Mis-matched and rather gaudy, he felt like it didn't fit him at all.
"Yeah, I learned my lesson after Okinawa," Midoriya said, a smile on his face, "I won't run out of mana again."
And that's when Natsuo calmed down his fashion panic and understood. The tall-tell signs of Midoriya and his magic pulsed from the gems.
Those gems were filled with Midoriya's magic.
"Where did you get them?" Natsuo asked.
"They were a gift," the young man replied, confused.
"...I'll get you some better ones," the older man said, frowning at the sight of them.
"...Are they ugly?"
"Uh..." They were. "They could be better," he said, "And I just want the best for you."
And more than any shiny rock and priceless gem, Midoriya's eyes shined brightly.


### limited collection

"Oh, it was a status effect?" Fatgum asked.
Dabi shrugged, "I don't care about that, how do I cast it again?"
Aizawa gave them both dirty looks, like he couldn't believe that he had to breath the same air as him.
"Don't look at me like that when you were thrusting in him as he lost conciousness," the dragon said.
"Not gonna lie," Yamada nodded, "I'm a bit jealous."
"It was great," Dabi replied back, and gave him a crooked grin, "though I doubt you would have been able to keep up with demand."
"Aw gee, didn't think I'd ever experience a dragon's concern," Yamada laughed, good-natured. "But since you don't have to worry about my performance quality since I won't finish in seconds." 
Dabi's blue eyes narrowed, his smile widened, and the area around fireplace felt cold. 
"Yikes," Fatgum whistled, "Put the claws away, kittens. Just wanted to know what had happened."
Midoriya, sleeping with his head in Vlad's lap, remained blissfully unaware of the conversation above.

-

Midoriya rubbed his neck as he got up. He felt like he slept well, rested well, if for a little too long, since his body felt tight. 
"Oh good, you're awake."
And without so much of a "good morning" or "how are you?" there were lips slanted across Midoriya. Even though he finally just managed to sit up, he could feel himself getting pushed back down onto his sheets. His hand came to Dabi's chest, wanting to push him off because he wanted to stand up and stretch his body, but the dragonkin placed his hand on top of his and squeezed his fingers. The warmth of his lips, as his hot tongue slid against his 

-

"Hey," Shigaraki asked, all but dropping onto the log in the space next to Midoriya. 
The young man looked up, mildly surprised but smiled warmly back.
The Demon Prince stared at him for a moment longer before he looked back forward.
Since the man wasn't speaking anymore, however, Midoriya looked back down and returned to cleaning out his blade. 
"...Are you really sleeping around with everyone here?"
Midoriya choked, and was careful not to split his skin against the blade.

>> post-chisaki + shigaraki

"Be careful," Aizawa's voice came out sharp, his hand grabbing Dabi's wrist, "That's a curse."
"Yeah, no shit," Dabi snapped back, but he stopped. Blue eyes stared forward, and if Aizawa could just feel the chill of death from this forest, he had no dobut that a magically-inclined dragon like Dabi could see it. 
The man hissed back, taking a step back as he scowled up at everything. Looking up and around, he sighed.
"It's gotta be at least a thousand or something years old. This shit is huge."
Behind them, the only person that Aizawa known to be afflicted with a curse, Yamada stood petrified. 
As much as Aizawa wanted to just storm into the forest, curse or not, to find his stupid wayward Master, he couldn't just abandon his friend-
"We can't just stay here," Yamada said, stepping forward. "I'm an ogre, I have higher resitance against curses and stuff anyways. I'll break through-"
Or not. As it would appear, Yamada was much stronger than he remembered.
"-We can't just leave him in there."
"You think I don't know that?" Dabi swiveled on his heel. "I-" he turned back, and if it was a curse that would make a mystical-class like a dragonkin hesitate, they had no doubt that the curse was something truly devastating.
And, as though to mock them for all their worries and grievances, Midoriya came running down the side of the mountain. He crashed against a tree, splintering it and ended up rolling down the last six feet of space. Smashing right against the tree, Aizawa rushed to catch him (totally not because he wanted to but because that's what a slave should do). Arms suddenly full of his Master, his heartbeat returned to him at the same time all the breath was knocked out of his chest. He slid back several feet on his knees, Yamada coming to help support him, and a sthe dust settled, Fatgum came running down the side of the hill. 
"Izuku!" he shouted, and Aizawa thanked all the gods that he wasn't the one sliding down because Aizawa and Yamada would be smeared into nothing if they had to stop him. "Are you okay?" 
"Augh," Midoriya sat up, holding his head, and Aizawa stared back.
His knees ached, burns and scratches from thefriction of sliding several feet, and against all of his desires, his arms slowly loosened around Midoriya.
"...2000 year curse," Dabi said, staring at the forest above wistfully, "shattered under the velocity of a rolling human."
"I'm sorry, what?"
Midoriya rolled to his knees, "Augh, I feel..." He teetered left to right, and Yamada came around to rub his hand on his back in soothing circles.
Dabi came to crouch in front of Midoriya, "You didn't get cursed," he gaped. 
Fatgum frowned, "Why would he get cursed?"
Yamada looked up to fill him in on the situation an the blond shook his head.
"No way, we didn't run into any problems while we were in there. Well, no more than usual."
"No more than..." Aizawa's eyes narrowed, because that, without a doubt, meant that-
And just like that, carrying the Demon Prince over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes, Vlad King joined them on Hound Dog's back. As he climbed off, their resident werewolf stood up, and returned to his half-human state. Shigaraki all but threw himself from Vlad King and circled himself to the other side of Midoriya, hissing and bristling like a suddenly drenched cat. 
"I told you to be careful!" Hound Dog barked out, several growls ripping from his throat. "Why'd you follow that light?!"
Aizawa closed his eyes, looks like they would be welcoming another person to their party. 
"He..." Midoriya took a few breaths and then sat back on his knees. His head pounding, admitted, "He said he needed help."
"...Who did?" Dabi asked, his tone flat and his expression cold, "And why were they important enough for you to try and break through a 2000 year curse for?"
"A-a what?" 
Predictably, Midoriya seemed to have no idea what he was talking about.
"It didn't feel a curse," he said.
"Yeah, you're welcome," Shigaraki sneered from the back where no one heard (or cared). He covered his mouth, "Augh, I'm going to be sick."
But before they lost Midoriya into another comforting-Shigaraki session, Aizawa's hands clapped on Midoriya's shoulder and he demanded in the form of a question.
"What did you promise."
"Ah," Midoriya said, like he remembered something. He pulled on the chain on his neck and Aizawa, who knew what would come, watched in morbid fascination, as Midoriya's hands clasped around the ring and called, "Kai."
Summoned in front of them, Overhaul stood in front of Midoriya. He looked at the sad sight his summoner was in, and sighed. Kneeling down in front of him, he raised his hand to his forehead, not touching, but hovering a few inches from his face.
"Filthy," he grimaced.
"Good afternoon, Kai-san."
The genie tilted his head to the side, "What did you do this time?" he asked, the same amount of exhaustion inching into his voice that Aizawa felt in his bones.
"I was wondering if you knew how to make a body," Midoriya replied, adjusting to stand up. He gave a grateful smile to Yamada for helping him up, and nothing to Aizawa, who skinned his knees catching him but he wasn't keeping count. Green eyes focused back on Chisaki, who straightened up.
His eyes looked Midoriya up and down, eyes trailing from his face to his feet and then back.
"I wouldn't have ever thought that your first request of me would be to give you a child."
Aizawa hissed, feeling as though something foul was being dragged through his territory. Somewhere further away, Hound Dog actually growled. 
"You can't do it?" 
"I'd be honored to," Chisaki said, hand coming up to pull on his necktie, "Though I'm not fond of having an audience, to refuse you is proving to be an impossible feat."
A bright smile, tinged only by his exhaustion, bloomed across his lips, and Midoriya nodded, "Thank you," he said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small bracelet. "Do you mind making him a body?"
"I... what?"
And maybe he was losing his mind, because Aizawa felt like he recognized that bracelet. He remembered it, and Yamamda startled, so maybe he wasn't fucking crazy, and maybe.
"Oh, that's dead," Overhaul said, narrowing his eyes. "I cannot bring the dead back to life." His eyes turned to the side, "but your Prince over there should be able to make him a servant."
"A... servant?" Midoriya repeated, and he turned his head to Shigaraki.
The older man frowned as he shuffled forward.
"I can?"
"2000 year curse," Dabi mumbled, staring at the trees. Vlad shot him a worried look, and Yamada came next to Aizawa.
"That's not..."
"I don't know," Aizawa muttered back. 
The thought never occured to him. While Aizawa was stuck in that cage, he had been so convinced that the world was a dark and awful place. That the people he called his comrades had sold him out and left him for a fate worse than death. He used to be so certain of it before, but not anymore. Since meeting Yamada, who got lynched when his curse was suddenly lifted and he couldn't fit with any ogre and humans landed him in the same fate as Aizawa, he started to wonder. If, out of all his friends, he had it the easiest, what would he do?
Was forgiveness somehting he could ask for?

-

The swell of magic, a condensation of magic that could only happen because there was the remains of a 2000 year curse and a Demon Prince and a Wish-Granter and of course, the human who was willing to be a sacrifice.
He stuck his hand out, blood spilling out of his wrist, and the cold promises of death melting under his gentle smile. 
"Come and answer my call. Let's see the world together."
And a black smoke swirled right in front of him, starting with where the Midoriya's blood had dripped onto the ground, and standing in arms' reach was a tall man with sky blue hair and shining eyes. 
Midoriya's eyes widened, his mouth opening and a breathless "wow" escaping from his mouth. The older man grinned back, taking his hands and pulling the open cut to his mouth. He kissed the cut, gave a languid lick, all while keeping eye-contact with his summoner. 
"My name is Shirakumo Oboro," he said, a wide grin on his face and his hair the color of a vibrant sky. He licked his lips, a dangerous red smeared on them, "For giving me this second life, this cloud will always return to you, Master of Mine."
"J-Just Midoriya is okay," Midoriya replied back, his face flushing hotly. "I... I uh... You're one of us, so just live comfortably," he said. 
Shirakumo hummed back, a wide grin on his face, "Still, thank you."
"I'm the one that brought him here," Shigaraki hissed.
"I'm the one that let his magic connect with a body," Chisaki grumbled. 
Vlad, eyes focused primarily on the fresh cut on Midoriya's wrist, licked his lips. 
His arms wrapped around Midoriya's waist, pulling him closer, and Hound Dog growled while Midoriya gave a quiet gasp.
The fire crackled between Dabi's fingers, even though his expression was blank. He stared forward, as though it was all he could see and he would engrave it into his memory. 
Eventually, Midoriya pulled himself out of the grasp, but his hands interlocked with Shirakumo without any intention to let go. He turned back to the others, "Let-let me introduce you to the others."
"Others?"
It was clear that Shirakumo hadn't even recognize that there were other people. But before anyone could haze the new guy, two others stepped forward first.
"Shi...Shirakumo!?"
Yamada launched himself at the man, and even Aizawa ran forward, his eyes watering as he threw his arms around the other man. 
"God," Shirakumo laughed, a wet sound magnified by their wet eyes and birhgt expression, "I've missed you bozos!"
Further back, Midoriya watched them and turned to the others, finally free from the hold. 
"Let's set camp someplace nearby," he said when he came to the others. He turned back over, his gaze turning tender as he stared at the mess of a reunion sprawled out on the ground, before he looked back at them, "and give them some space. I'm sure they have a lot to talk about."
Shigaraki leaned in and bit on his lips. 
"Don't think I'm letting this go," he growled out before he stalked off. 
And face tinted red, Midoriya covered his lips with a hand, as he tried to calm himself down. Lunch, he told himself. They needed to make lunch. 

-

"I worked really hard today," Shigaraki said, crawling over Midoriya like a large cat. He licked his lips as they stretched into a wide grin. His hands came to either side of Midoriya's head, and he stretched his chest over his. "And got you a new servant today, too," he said.
"He's not a servant," Midoriya's voice was firm, "That's a desgiation, but not who he is."
Shigaraki took one look at his expression and gave a long sigh. "Fine," he mumbled. He dropped his head in the area next to Midoriya's head, and moved his hands to wrap around Midoriya's waist, all but shoving the human this way and that to get a proper grasp on him. 
And Midoriya, understanding without being told, lifted his hand up to run through the back of Shigaraki's head.
"Thanks for helping me out," he said, "I really couldn't have done it without you."
Shigaraki hummed back, a deep sound that almost sounded like a purr, as he rubbed his face into Midoriya's shoulder.
"I'm really lucky that you were there. Your magic has gotten a lot more refined too. I didn't feel any backlash from the spell either. You pick things up really quickly. I would have never guessed that you were seeing the world for the first time. I think you're the one that's guiding me around, you know?" He sighed, "I really can't do anything without the people around me. I guess I'm the lucky one-"
Shigaraki suddenly pushed himself up, and jolted Midoriya into silence.
"Shiga-"
Shut up," he said.
"Huh?"
"I said, shut up." 
Their noses rubbed against each other and he kissed him.
"I wouldn't have helped him if you didn't tell me to," he said, their lips running against each other. "I wouldn't have ever stepped into the sun if I didn't have you."
He pushed up onto his knees and with a big sigh, he pulled Midoriya up into a sitting position. He kissed him again, his lips and his forehead and the tip of his nose before he got back to his lips again. With his face so close that their eyelashes touched, Shigaraki hummed.
"You get what I'm trying to say, right?" he asked. "That the lucky one is me."
Midoriya's voice seized in his throat, and Shigaraki kissed away all his doubts. With a hand on the back of his head and the other on his back, he gently pushed him back down. With a wide grin, he hovered over him again, like he had just a few moments ago.
"Should I prove it to you?" he asked.

-

"A... summoner?"
Hawks nodded. "

-

"When humans sin, they can become demons," Shigaraki said, "with my blessings of course." He shrugged, "and demons can become humans too."
"Really?" Midoriya perched up, "What do I need to do?"
"...Well, if they turn human, but they lived past their life expectancy as a demon, they'd probably turn to dust and die. That's the theory, but I've never seen it myself."
"Yeah, but how can you turn a demon into a human?"
There was a moment of silence, and the man sighed.
"Peace," he explained. "Peace turns a demon into a human."
Midoriya stared at Shigaraki and covered his mouth.
"The Power of Vitamin D..."
"Yeah, they usually need a human catal... what?"
"V-Vitamin D?" Midoriya tried again, "Uhm... Sunlight. Like photosynthesis?"
And that pinched expression on his face had returned, like he didn't know if he wanted to hit Midoriya or himself. 
"...Nevermind," the young man said, dipping his head. "Y-You mentioned something about a human catapillar?"
"Catalyst," he deadpanned. He squinted at him and then sighed. "You know what? Don't worry about it."
"Eh?" 
Shigaraki scowled back. "I mean, even if I told you, it's just speculation. No one's ever made a demon turn back into a human."
"...You know," Midoriya said quietly, "There's a saying where I'm from, that 'Life is stranger than fiction' and uh... It applies here, you know?"
"Huh?"
Midoriya grinned, a litle more certain.
"It means that stories can be a toned-down reality."
And between a human and a demon lord, his words felt especially true.

"I'm quirkless," Midoriya replied, waving his hand. 
"You don't want to change that?"
The young man laughed back, a sounds bright and small like Christmas lights on in the dead of the night. 
"No way," he said, "I don't want to be invincible."

### way back home

The weight of someone who believed in you was heavy. Inui, who only saw the fact that Midoriya was never alone, never understood that.
Green eyes peered at him, and he gave a smile.
"If you go out that way, you'll hit the streets. Follow the street for a mile or so, and you should hit a small city. There should be a bus there that can take you to the station."
"...That sounds like you won't come with me."
Midoriya stared at him, all wide-eyed and surprised, and that ugly bubbled up from inside of him. Inui gnashed his teeth, a low growl building up inside of him before he stifled it. The last thing he wanted to do was prove Midoriya right, prove everyone right and show that he's just some slobbering beast that was nothing. 
"...There's something I left behind," Midoriya replied, just as softly. "I'll meet up with you later."
"...Let's go," he said, "Together."
The young man hesitated, and Inui frowned.
Learning how low the expectation was for him made him bitter.

-

Inui laughed, because it felt so fucking simple. It was such an obvious thing. He thought about it, and it was annoying to think that the damned rat was right, but he was right. He was always right. 
People were simple creatures.
"Izuku, dear," he said, arm wrapping around Midoriya's shoulder and pulling him close. It was weird to think that someone so small could pull the sun out from behind the clouds, but maybe Inui was just thinking about this wrong the whole time. "This way," he said, tugging him towards the ramen stand, "C'mon. Let's eat."
"A-Are you sure?"
"Yeah," Inui laughed, pulling him close and he understood why they worked so hard to keep him in eyesight and arms' reach. 
It was so simple. 
"Let's go."
And on the other side, Kan stood next to Midoriya. With a grin that made him look much younger than before, Inui wondered if he was finally meeting this man.
"I'll be in a bad place if you cancel so suddnely," he said, eyes warm. 
"R-really?"
"Oh, definately," Inui laughed, because it wasn't a lie.
