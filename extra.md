## 3 "I'm not jealous"

Eraserhead released her hand, gently pat her on the head with the same hand before he waved at her. "Sleep well," he said.

Eri laughed, a bright sound that used to be so rare but no less valuable. 

"Okay, gnight, Aiza-san!" Despite how quietly she said it, her eyes shined like stars and she looked fit to burst. Her vocabulary and pronunciations would come with time, but compared to the shell of a child they found earlier, she had come a long way. She turned to the side, and her eyes widened comically, "Night, Deku-" and then looking around, said, "Commander-san!"

Eraserhead turned around, and gave a polite bow when he saw his Commander. The young man looked tired, if a little annoyed, but all of that disappeared in an instant as he waved back at Eri.

"Good night," he called back. And as Eri rushed off to where Froppy (who also bowed politely at the sight of them before leaving) was waiting, Eraserhead walked up next to Deku.

"Good evening, Commander."

Deku looked at him and then the ground. "Yeah," he said, brisk and turning back forward.

The older man frowned, his good mood from earlier dissipating. His eyebrows furrowed, and he ran through a check-list in his head. Deku was upset, but he wasn't panicking. in all honestly, there weren't a lot that got Deku like this. Either he was silent, blank-faced, mourning what was lost, or he was actively running around in a near-panic to protect something before it slipped out of his grasp. This kind of quiet brooding didn't fit him at all.

"...Is something unsatisfactory?" he asked.

Deku paused and looked up at him, and then his frown deepened as he turned back forward, "I... It's nothing."

Eraserhead raised an unimpressed eyebrow at him. They took a few more steps, and he took a deep breath in. 

"It'll always be something to me," he said.

The young man startled, like he didn't expect it. His eyes were wide as he looked at Eraserhead's face, as though expecting him to take his words back or there to be a joke at the end. It never came, because Eraserhead would never joke about that kind of thing, and the older man watched the emotions cycle across Deku's features. His eyebrows twitching and his mouth opening and closing before he pursed his lips and furrowed his brow. 

Eraserhead wanted to hit him. When they offered their vows and promised their hearts, what did he hear? The young man covered his face with his hands, and Eraserhead watched how his tears start to turn red. As best he could, he tried to keep a neutral expression as he waited. 

"It's just..."

He could hardly believe that this was the same person that commanded so sharply on the battlefield. The courage to face a cyclops with a broken arm had all but deserted him as he mumbled something.

"I didn't catch that," Eraserhead. "And would hope you wouldn't hold that against me."

He sucked his cheeks in, looking up at him again, and the older man resisted the urge to kiss him senseless and pull him into the closest tent (it was Red Riot's, so he'd give it up without a fuss too) so he could prove it to Deku over and over again, as many times as he needed to-

"You don't do that."

Eraserhead frowned, but kept his mouth shut. It looked like Deku had something to say, but was struggling to get it out. It was fine, Eraserhead was a patient man and he would patiently wait for Deku to figure out the words he wanted to use to articulate the storm in his head. He was rewarded a few seconds later.

"You don't hold my hand like that."

His mind went blank. The image of Deku, his Commander and Saivor of the Eights Paths, staring at the ground, his bottom lip jutting out just a little bit, his cheeks red, had him so shocked that he stopped walking. To preserve the image as long as possible, his eyes strained to stay open. 

Deku stopped too. Looking at the ground before he slowly turned around to look up at him. 

"I... get lost too, you know."

"...You were jealous?" Eraserhead deadpanned, more to confirm for himself.

"I-I'm not jealous," he spluttered back, face flushing a bright red that didn't suit the Bearer of the Cursed Sword but endeared him all the same. 

"Of course," Eraserhead agreed, feeling as though he was dreaming awake. 

Deku covered his face, hiding his adorable expression from Eraserhead's vision. 

The older man took a step in, taking his hand and pulling it from his face. 

"It wasn't my intention to leave you unsatisfied-"

"-uh-unsatis-"

He kissed Deku's knuckles as he made eyecontact, hiding a sly smile behind his fingers when he saw his beloved Commander's breath hitch. 

"I would be honored for an opportunity to right my wrongs," he purred out, feeling his throat itch from how low he dropped his voice, but the shiver that ran through Deku was all worth it, "and to reaffirm my vows to you."

The young man let out this strangled sound from deep in his voice, his face flushed, but he nodded. 

"I-I... I'd like that. Very much."

Somehow, they made it to Deku's tent. 

## idk 

Eraserhead passed the next report over to him, the official letters asking for Deku to return to the Empire to join the New Years' celebration. They came a long way, if those stuffy nobles were agreeing to bring them to their prestigious meet-ups, even if it was just a publicity stunt. No doubt, Deku would be thinking about getting everyone out of the cold for a few days, and would agree. While Eraserhead would like to be out of the cold as well, he would rather have his teeth chatter from the winter's chill than subjugate his beloved Commander to their condescending stares and needling words. 

For Deku too, didn't he think it was better to face the cold together? If Eraserhead had it his way, he'd never feel the cold ever again. How nice would that be? No demons, no politics, no Dabi or the others, no more paperwork. Just the two of them and a few cats, lazing in bed until the sun was high in the sky.

>> background apocalypse & eri + kouta are the only publishing mangaka

Summary: Eri huffed and placed her hands on her hips, "Well, when you can rub enough braincells together to write your own story, you can write what you want."

Kouta glared back. "One day," he seethed back, snatching the manuscript out of her hands, "One fucking day."

-

There are 8 Twices walking in and out of the same room. And that's how the rest of the base knows.

The next chapter is about to be released.

-

"And you're okay with this?" Hawks asked, waving the dj in front of Midoriya's face.

Midoriya stared at the doujin, a drawn picture of him in a rauchy bunny-suit looking up at the camera, and he sighed.

"Do you remember?" he asked, "When they first came in?"

Hawks frowned, and Midoriya looked back forward.

"I remember. Eri threw up everything she ate and cried all night. Kouta never spoke and never moved, and if anyone touched him, they'd be scratched and bitten."

The blond stared and looked down. He remembered. The first children they had seen in months, living like rats. They found Eri after Kouta, and at least they were better prepared for her, but Kouta especially was hard. Hawks remembered, one several occasions, some of the others recommending to just put him out of his misery.

"But now they know how to read and write. They laugh and smile and they're working hard for a future," he replied. He took the doujinshi and took it out of Hawks' hand. Looking down at it, he gave a resigned smile with a shrug, "It's fiction. They're still good kids. And you know, base has been a little more lively recently."

Hawks stared at him for a moment and crossed his arms over his chest. Talking to Midoriya like this made him feel like the world was a bright and beautiful place.

"Fuck you, maid's are the best, you furry!"

"Shut up, you stupid earthworm! It's not furry, it's scaley!"

Midoriya smile kept its place, and Hawks didn't think he would ever meet someone as strong as him.

-

"Chisa-ji is not nearly as bad as you write him out to be," Kouta said.

Eri gave a sharp cry, sounding more like a yowl-like someone pulled the plug on Shigaraki's game again- and turned to Kouta with the promise of pain in her eyes.

"You didn't know him pre-Izu-nii."

Kouta rolled his eyes, "Yeah, but child experimentation? Come on, that's such a gimmie. Why can't you make him 3-D instead of some Jesus freak?"

Eri flushed holty, "Augh! You're so stupid, Kouta! It's just a character quirk! You said you wanted to try with the religious scriptures!"

"I never said that!" Kouta shouted right back. "Just that altar-sex would be fun to try!"

"Same difference! You just want to summon another demon, you monster-fucker!"

"You leave Chimera-san out of this!"

-

"So uh..." Yamada coughed into his fist, looked up and down the hallway, and then leaned in closer, "Any chance on some Present Mic/Deku?"

Kouta gave him this dead-eyed look, and as though he was just counting down to the last minute where he didn't have to be here anymore, pointed at window next to him where they had a whiteboard and a box. On the whiteboard, several names and tropes were listed, along with a list of numbers. 

The blond stared and sighed, "That's not fair, Shota always wins."

"Then stop being a loser," Kouta deadpanned back. "We have plenty of those without you adding to them."

Present Mic opened his mouth, closed it, and then looked down at the table, trying to remember a time when people cheered and stopped him for selfies.

-

"Augh," Shigaraki hissed, "This was fucking awful."

Kouta wasn't sure who he was fooling, with his red-rimmed eyes rubbed raw and the crack in his voice.

"Absolute garbage."

He returned the small doujinshi (an angsty short AiDeku because they had a lot of requests for it) with a scowl on his face, but they all knew the truth. No doubt, Shigaraki put another request for fluff into their box and walked away. 

"For a guy who complains so much," Kouta sighed, "You'd think he'd just stop reading it."

"Guess he didn't hate it that much after all," Eri replied.

-

And then the library system was created and there was a new acknowledgement.

No one wanted to borrow a book after Shigaraki.
