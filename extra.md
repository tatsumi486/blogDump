"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

"...There is kindness in the world because there are people in it," Deku said quietly. "People who could give it, and people who recieve it."
Next to him, Aizawa looked at him like his heart was breaking. The young man looked up at him and gave a helpless shrug.
"Your kindness will be wasted on them," Stain hissed out, landing next to him. "You think that guys like that will change?"
Deku lifted his bat up.
"Don't worry," he said, "I know how to take responsibility for my actions."

Izuku lifted his empty box of bullets, "More."
Vlad King waved back, and turned back around, probably to get him another box, when another voice spoke up.
"You know, I dream about you saying that," Dabi said, face resting on his hands, arm propped up on the table as he gazed at Izuku.
Izuku finished loading the magazine with bullets and placed it on the table where the rest of his finished magazines were. He stood up and started to pack them into the crates in neat stacks.
Dabi took a deep breath, probably wanting more but actually held his tongue for once. He adjusted his posture, sitting with his back against the table as he leaned against it. He closed his eyes and relaxed his body, and to anyone who didn't know him, dropped his guard. 
But anyone who knew Dabi, and knew how he fought, knew that the man was a walking death trap for anyone unfortunate enough to be within a 15 feet radius.
Izuku got out of his seat, but left the crate of magazines on the table. He walked over to Dabi, the older man opened his eyes, curious and interested. And then Izuku placed his hand on Dabi's shoulder, and leaned in. Dabi's eyebrows shot up to his hairline, blue eyes bright like they were electrified, and Izuku placed on knee to his side and then climbed up into his lap. Straddling the older man, his hands came to his shoulders and he leaned forward. 
Dabi's jaw clenched and unclenched. His hands came up to Izuku's hips, a bruising grip as his pupils started to narrow into slits. His breathing started to labor, and he licked his lips. Izuku's hands slid up from his shoulder to cup his face. Gently, he tilted his head up. 
"I want more, Dabi," he said, voice like sin to Dabi's ears, "Can you do that for me?"
Dabi didn't hesitate.
"What..." he licked his lips, and gulped once, "What can I do for you?"
"Get me some more magazines. I'm done with these," Izuku replied, face devoid of expression as he got off of him. He dusted himself off and grabbed the crate of magazines he left on the table. He pushed them to Dabi's chest. "Take those to Nighteye for inventory."
Dabi's hands came to the box, and he scowled.
"One day," he said, "that won't work on me."
Izuku arched an eyebrow at him, before his expression smoothed out. With the smile of a saint, he took a step back.
"One day," Izuku agreed, "But not today."
Dabi's scowl deepened and he stood up, with the box in his hands.
"Not today," he grumbled out, walking out to do as his Leader pleased.

"...Well, good behavior should be rewarded," Izuku said as he dropped into the seat Compress held for him. "So, what do you want? Supplies? Medicine? A tent?"
The man slowly brought his eyes up, "A... night," he said quietly. 
"A night?"
"A night with you, sir."
Hound Dog started to growl, and within a second, there were several loaded guns aimed at his head.
Izuku laughed, "Amazing," he said, "You could have asked for safety, security, santion for you and your entire group. And instead, you just want sex?"
"I-I just... I've never met someone as beautiful as you," he said, keeping his gaze on the ground.
And Izuku tilted his head, curiously staring at the man in front of him. To the chargin of the others, he walked right up to him and crouched down in front of him. He reached out and grabbed his chin and leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
Despite how hte silence rang, no one could hear what Izuku said.
The young man stood up, "Alright. A promise is a promise. Clean up. And..." he trailed off, looking to the side and made eye-contact with Compress. "Compress, make sure he gets to my nest."
Compress gave a violent flinch back.
"I..." He hesitated but ultimately bowed, "Yes sir."
Izuku turned back to the stranger, "When morning comes, I'll release you. Keep up."
And he turned to leave.
Predictably, Shigaraki was growling and hissing as he came to the door he was hiding behind.
"Keep on the perimeter," Izuku said quietly.
"Can't we just kill him?" Shigaraki mumbled back, "It's not like you want him here either."
"No way," the young man said, a smile curling on his face, "This is going to be more fun."
After all, it was clear that the stranger's group was trying to bank on the fact that the leader was an omega. They must have seen him as the easiest picking. Put in one of their alphas, try to cozy up to him, and then assume control over the base as the Alpha. It was so cute and ignorant that Izuku couldn't help but play along.
The look on their face when Izuku pulled the rug out from underneath them was going to be hilarious.
"I can be fun," Shigaraki muttered out. 
Izuku blinked back. Did Shigaraki really think that he was going to sleep around with some stranger? He didn't know whether he was concerned for Shigaraki or mildly insulted.
Wasn't that funny? Izuku didn't even realize that he cared about what Shigaraki thought. His mood soured, and he walked on instead. 

-

"Well, as you can see, everyone hates me," Izuku said, "So, what do they have that's worth your life?" He tilted his head, "I can't imagine that you've heard good things about me, after all."

-

"I wouldn't," Izuku said, not once looking away from the window, "It's dirty."
Present Mic had followed Izuku out to battle many times. It's far and few in between that he's seen the young man so exhausted. The moonlight really didn't help, as it bathed Izuku's skin in an aerethal glow, and made the shadows on his face look deeper and darker. His breathing was labored, and Present Mic didn't doubt that he was still trying to catch his breath. His chest heaved with every breath, and Yamada doubted that all the blood on him, and in this room, was the enemies.
First-aid in hand, he walked into the room.
"C'mon," he said, "Lemme take a look at that for you."
Izuku moved then, "It... It's not pretty," he said.
"That... really doesn't mean anything to me."
And then Izuku covered his face with one of his hands. The other one remained limp in his lap, and Present Mic wondered how long he would have been here, trying to catch his breath and regain feeling in his body.
"I wanted to look good in front of you," he said.
"You do," the blond said, kneeling in front of him. "You always do."
Izuku gave a sardonic scoff. He shook his head and turned in his seat and lifted his bad arm with his good arm. The bloody mess made the blond gag on the sudden stench.
"Told you so," Izuku said. 
And Yamada would be laying on the ground, screaming in pain if it were him. Izuku just made some sarcastic comments.
"You're stronger than me," he said.
"If I was, I wouldn't have gotten injured."
Yeah, he didn't have anything to say to that. Since well, he didn't know what happened. He popped open the first-aid. Where did he even begin with this mess? Just wipe of the blood and wrap it up so that his organs stay on the inside until they can get him to base? 
"...What happened?"
"I misjudged my timing."
Present Mic nodded, grimacing at the sight of flapping skin and exposed bone. He was too squeamish for this shit-
"I can do it," Izuku said, and Present Mic believed him. He doubted there was anything Izuku couldn't do for himself. His entire being practically preached independence. If there was a way to do it alone, Izuku had it down pat. 
"I... I want to do something for you for once," Present Mic said.
And he heard from the others that Izuku was different when he was injured. A little more calm and a bit less snappy. Since the first time he saw Izuku's face landed him with a swelling face, he didn't really take it at face-value.
But then, Izuku dropped his arm and reached over to grab Present Mic's shoulder.
"You don't owe me anything," he said, expression cold. "And I don't owe you anything."
To anyone else, it might have sounded like a mercy, but all Present Mic heard was that Izuku wanted no relationship with him. 
It stung.
With that, Izuku stood up. Blood ran like a river, but he didn't even limp as he made his way out the door, leaving Present Mic in the room filled with blood.



### solo lvl

Midoriya's head drooped a little, as he started to nod off. Natsuo gave a small smile, an instinctual response when he saw something particularly cute. And then, Midoriya's body swayed a little more and his head was against Natsuo's arm. 
The movie continued to play in front of them, but all Natsuo could focus on was Midoriya's quiet breathing. Heightened Hunter ability was especially good for moments like this. 
He should probably move them.
"...He fell asleep?"
Grey eyes met summer blue eyes. Touya came out, a tray of three mugs steaming. He sighed.
"Do you want to drink his or should I?" he asked, placing the tray on their coffee table. 
"Ah..." Natsuo sighed. "You can have it."
"It was a trick question, you're drinking it," Touya said, slowly sliding into the seat on the other side of Midoriya. He reached to the other side of him and pulled the blanket out.
Wordlessly, Natsuo grabbed one edge of the blanket and pulled it over him and Midoriya. He reached his arms across the back of the couch, and Touya tilted his head back against his arm like a makeshift pillow. Midoriya scooted closer to him, and rested his head against his chest.
Natsuo turned the movie down a little quieter.
"...I can't move," he suddenly realized, "Can you pass me my hot chocolate?"
"I'm comfortable," Touya said, eyes closed on his arm. "So fuck you."
"Niichan," he hissed.
"Nat-kun."
"Niichan," he tried again.
Touya didn't even twich, "Nat-chan."

-

"...Requests?"
"There's a lot of them, mostly people who want to work with Japan's Number One Supporter. I'm sure there's a few that want to recruit him one way or another."
Natsuo felt it again, that cold sensation that gripped his heart.
"...If there are people better for him, you should be prepared for our party to diffuse-"
"Wha-How can you say that?!" Natsuo shouted back, shocked that his brother would say anything like that.
"Natsuo," Touya's voice was cold. "I'd rather him alive. It doesn't matter how good we are. If there is someone he was better synergy with, then he should be with them."
"But we-"
"If the only reason why he's partying with us is because we're romantically involved, then he needs to find a new party," his brother continued. He tilted his head, and narrowed his eyes, "Natsuo. Is it more important that he's alive or that you're with him?"
And it wasn't fair. Because now that Toyua phrased it like that, it was obvious what the right thing to say was. He hated that about his brother. His hands clenched tightly into fists. He...
