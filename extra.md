"...A school?"
Yamada nodded, "A senpai of mine invited me. A university with the focus of hunters. Raising them, helping taking care of finances, and helping network into the bigger playing field, things like that."
"Is there enough things to even teach them?" Dabi asked, joining the conversation as he jumped over the back of the couch and settled in next to Midoriya. His arm came behind Midoriya's head and he bent it so that he could rest his head against his fist. "Sounds like a money-grubbing scheme."
"We say a university, but it'll be run more like a community college. According to the Association, we'll be a guild too. An introductory-guild for people starting out."
With a tray of several cups of hot tea, Natsuo came forward. "That's nice and all, but why are you telling us?"
"Shota and I are going to go teach," Yamada said. "So our pressence here is going to be spotty."
In the background, Twice cheered. Midoriya shot him an exapserated look while the other three ignored him.
"And we were wondering if you would like to come too. Maybe not as explicit teaching staff, but if we have more high-ranking hunters, we can provide a safer experience for kids coming in."
"You're just asking us to take responsibility," Dabi summarized. "Yamada, what happens in gate, happens in a gate. By the time we come out-"
"I know, all we have are the people that are alive. But we just don't want any more people dying than they have to. That's why Shota and I are going for this."
"What about Shirakumo?" Natsuo asked. "Are you going to take him with you?"
The blond gave a crooked grin. "We're warming him up to it right now."
"When are you guys going to start?" Natsuo asked, "The spring semester?"
"Next fall," Yamada replied, "And we'll have some trial runs for the summer to help with the fine tuning."
"Dabi, Natsuo, I don't think it's a bad idea," Midoriya said quietly.
"You too," Yamada said quickly, "The invitation is for all of you." And then, he took a deep breath, "even Twice."
"Whoa! Seriously? You trust me that much?!" Twice came running in, eyes wide and Yamada grimaced. "I hate kids though. //I love kids so much!"
"You never hire half a raid-team," the blond said, "The point of these classes is to try and decrease the number of people who die from avoidable deaths. And well..." Yamada rubbed his neck, "There's been more and more younger people that have been awakening. No one wants to send a kid to their death."
Midoriya stared back and looked at his knees. "I haven't... graduated from high school," he said. "I don't think they'll take me seriously."
"Then they'll die," Yamada cut in. "Working against a Supporter or a Healer is pretty much death in most dungeons. If they don't learn it, they'll die." He paused, and then gave a small grin, "But don't worry, there won't be that many people who pick on an S-Class Supporter. I'll see to it."
Midoriya stared at him for a moment longer and then back to the ground. Wringing his fingers together, he shook his head.
"I... I need time."
"...Midoriya," Yamada said, "You don't owe us anything. If this is something you want to do, then you can do it, but you're not required or anything to do it. Shota, Oboro, and I will still be around." 

-

For all the critism that they recieved, however, there were an overflowing amount of applicants.
Midoriya leaned his head against the wall and thought. 
"Whoa, Midoriya?"
Natsuo stumbled on him, a tray of three mugs of hot chocolate in his hands, and he blinked. Midoriya turned over, eyes landing on the tall tower of whipped cream in the cups, with chocolate shavings and cinnamon powder on them, and looked back at Natsuo. Without another word or even a twitch, two different temperature and time preservation spells came on their drinks, letting Natsuo know that the young man wanted to talk. Just the two of them, in the hallway.
"I'm scared of school," he said. He covered his face. "I know, I know it's stupid. Because it's not like it can hurt me or anything but I'm just... I'm so scared. I hate it. I hate this."


### kind nightmare

"Shall we... raise our level?" Yamada asked, waggling his eyebrows at Midoriya. He leaned in close enough to rub their noses together, but right before their lips touched, Midoriya backed off. 
A bright red flush crossed his features immediately, and he gave a curt nod. "R-Right," and he turned around to grab the box underneath his bed. "I-I uhm... I have some of the candles-"
Yamada's arms reached over him, and he pulled the box further away. With his other hand, he turned Midoriya back around, and flat on his back. Looming over the smaller man, he hummed back. 
"We don't need those, sweetheart," he said, a grin on his face.
"R-really?"
And the confusion in his voice made him pause. The English teacher frowned and pulled back. His hands grabbed Midoriya's hands and pulled him up. Sitting together on Midoriya's bed, the blond stared at Midoriya.
"I know I shouldn't be saying this, as your teacher and all," Yamada said, "but you know, 

-

"So let me get this straight," Dabi said, "You're trying to get through this dungeon to find your mom. There are monsters in the dungeon, and to win against them, you fuck to get stroner."
Midoriya winced but nodded.
Dabi nodded, "Then, there was a reason why you got me, didn't you?"
The young man nodded again, guilty.
"I thought that no one would miss you."
It stung. Something that Dabi didn't realize that he still had stung. It made his jaw clench and his hands flex. He nodded slowly.
"...You know, we're not in there. I could just kill you."
He nodded back. "I know."
The taller man tilted his head to the side. "You know? So what, you're waiting for me to off you? No, that's wrong... You're the self-sacrificing type. Do you think that if I'm busy with you, I won't harass innocents out there?"
Midoriya covered his face, and Dabi gave out this bitter laugh.
"What the fuck?" he asked, his hand coming up to cover his face. 
He took a deep breath and leaned his head back. Arms dropping to his side, Midoriya would be the one person that could admit that he had taken the fight out of Dabi. Instead of relishing in the sense of victory, the young man curled up into a tighter ball and awaited a fate worse than death.
"And now?"
The teen shook his head.
"Tell me. You owe me at least that."
He flinched. There was a moment of silence before he moved his hands to cover his face. Even like that, however, Dabi could see how red his ears had gotten.
"I like the way you make me feel."
Something in his heart loosened. Taking a step forward, he crouched down in front of him.
Dabi placed his hand on one of Midoriya's knees, his palms bigger than his kneecaps, and Midoriya flinched back.
"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm sorry-"
He grabbed the young man's arms and pulled them away from his face.
"Don't apologize," he said. "I don't want to hear the guy I like apologizing for liking me."
Midoriya stilled and slowly be brought his head up.
"You... You don't mean-"
"If you make me repeat it, I'll get shy," the older man deadpanned, but Midoriya's hands grabbed his shirt.
"You don't mean that. It's not real. You don't actually like me. There's no way-"
"You really know how to piss a guy off," Dabi sighed, "You only look at me to tell me that I don't know what I'm feeling." He grabbed his wrists, and pushed them to the wall on either side of his head. "What do I need to do to prove it? I can make you feel like that, for as long as you want me too. You get that right?"
"It's not real! It's just... just fabricated feelings from these items!" Midoriya yelled back, "If it weren't for these items, we wouldn't have ever... ever met." He quickly lost steam, his arms falling slack in Dabi's grip.
"Then, let's finish this," Dabi said, "And you'll know, right? Whether or not this is real, we'll know then. But you know, right now?" He leaned in, rubbing their noses together and resting his forehead against his. He took a deep breath, and gave him a small smile.
In the two inches between their lips, Midoriya recieved a confession from someone who once wanted to burn the whole world down.

-

"Aren't we going to...?" Midoriya's voice trailed off as Dabi climbed into bed with him, his clothes still on, and more importantly, letting Midoriya keep his clothes on.
"I'm not so easy that I'd have sex on the first date," he said. He propped his head on his fist, and looked down at Midoriya next to him. "Though I suppose I could make an exception for you."
Midoriya's face darkened, and he laughed.
"

-

"I confessed," Dabi blurted out.
Twice stopped cold, and placed his bowl of salad on the counter.
"...And?" he asked, "What did Izuku say?"
Dabi leaned against the doorframe. "That he liked me too."
The blond stared at him, and then the counter. He pushed the salad further back and then placed his forehead down on the cool counter.
"Well damn," he said. "Are you guys... together?"
"Nope," Dabi replied. It came out airy, like he didn't care at all. "He didn't believe me."
Twice looked up, "Yeah, I can see that. You're not the honest-kind. // I'll always believe you!" He gave a hearty laugh and resumed stirring the salad. "Besides, just because he likes you now," he took the serving spoon out of the salad bowl and pointed it at Dabi, "doesn't mean he'll like you when this is all over."
The man gave a broad grin, like Dabi had just made his day.
And of course, Dabi would never admit it, but he looked better like that than he did before. He gave a crooked grin back, and wondered if Midoriya knew that he saving people didn't just mean taking them out of a dangerous situation.
"Yeah, yeah, what are you doing anyways?"
"Midoriya said he wanted cake," Twice explained, with his bowl of salad and a serving spoon.
Dabi eyed it and nodded. Midoriya would be fine. He can't take a dick like Endeavor's and die from eating whatever strange conconation Twice made. 
"I'm sure he'll love it."
Power of Love and all that.

-

"...That offer of yours," Dabi said, rubbing the back of his head, "Is it still availiable?"
Hawks stared at Dabi, eyes wide and mouth agape before he nodded his head.
"Yeah. You'll be working under me. You... sure?"
The older man nodded his head, and sighed.
"Yeah. That old man of mine," he sighed, leaning back in his seat, "I don't think I can work with him. Even seeing him here and now..." He rubbed his chest, "He feels like a stranger. At that point I'd rather go with an actual stranger."
The blond nodded. "I understand. We'll get that ready for you."
"And besides, when you guys go to leave Midoriya high and dry, someone's gotta keep him safe."
"Someone like you?"
Dabi laughed back. "Of course not. I'm not a hero. The best I can do is buy him some time."
But the look in his eyes spoke of a man with ambition and greed. Hawks wondered if Dabi knew how full of shit he was. 
Just in case, he mentioned it. "You're full of shit."
The man deadpanned back, "Pot; kettle."

### apoc 

"Here."
Shigaraki took the beer from Endeavor. A situation he never thought he would be in. 
"Thanks," Shigaraki replied, awkwardly as he took the alcohol. "Can you even drink this?" he asked.
"I burn through it," the man replied back. He leaned against the fridge as he popped the can open. "What about you?"
"This isn't enough to do me in," Shigaraki replied back.
There was a long moment of silence. Two men just enjoying their beer on the rooftop under the moonlight.
"You know," Shigaraki started, feeling his inhibitions loosen, "I used to hate peace."
Endeavor didn't say anything, and leaned against the railing, looking down. Shigaraki leaned back on his hands, and watched them pass across the stars. 
"Thought it was boring. It wasn't real. We're just... mindless sheep waiting for the world to come crumbling apart."
"And now?"
"Really want to take a nap for the week."

### way back home
All former OFA-holders (except Shimura Nana + Yagi Toshinori) are middle schoolers (1-2 yrs younger than Midoriya)

Shigaraki Yoichi -> Tenko's cousin. His older twin died in an accident and has been holed up in his room since. midoriya meets him and drags him out so that he goes back to high school and can graduate
Hikage Shinomori (Danger Sense) ->  a cowardly mangaka who's afraid of everything. meets Midoriya at the hospital (dad is unwilling to get treatment and wants to go die on his farm not here and Midoriya changes his mind). Eventually inherits the farm and invites midoriya.
Shun - > Banjo Daigoro (Recovery Girl's Stray) -> will end up taking over the candy store.
En (smokescreen) -> some random tourist? Really shady connections to mainland China (according to Chisaki)
>> update Di

-

"Yeah, I wouldn't have guessed that they were related at all," Toyomitsu laughed. "Pretty impressive, in that sense, Midoriya."
Midoriya smiled back, "They don't have to share a name to be related."
Shigaraki's spoon clinked the bowl and he stared at the young man in front of him.
"Oh? Then, will you adopt me?" he asked, cheeky grin and all.
"I'll be honored to," the young man replied. "In your inaguration, you can do the dishes."
"Ouch, that's cold Midoriya."
Midoriya's smile was sweet, and Toyomitsu was doing the dishes before he left.

-

Bakugo blanched when he saw the test scores. He looked at it, and then to Kirishima, and grabbed him by his hair.
"What the hell is in here?!" he shouted, "How'd you fuck up this badly? Did you even try?!"
"I'm sorry!" Kirishima yelled back. "But that's why I'm asking for help!"
Midoriya nodded back, "We're going to the family diner to study after this," he said. "Do you want to come with us?"
"Wait, is this an open session!?" Kaminari yelled out, running forward, "Me too! Please, take me too!"
Quietly, Koda shyly raised his hand.
"If it's a group this big, it might be better to do it at someone's house," Tokoyami pointed out, sliding into the seat next to Midoriya. He gave a meaninful look towards Iida, who straightened at the wordless invitation.
"Then, as the Class Representative, I would like to extend an invitation to all of you!"
"Whoa! As expected of the Volunteer Class Rep!" Kirishima clapped.
"Always looking out for us!" Sero cheered.
"He's so reliable!" Kaminari added.
Iida looked like he was about to burst from the compliments. 
"Of course! I am happy to help my friends!"
There was a brief pause and Tsuyu poked her head into the conversation.
"Is this a boys-only thing?"
"Of course not," Iida announced, "it's for anyone who wants to pursue knowledge!"
"Eh, so it's fine if I come, right?" Shinso asked, sliding the door open. "Hope you have a big enough place to house all of us."
Iida nodded, "I will not let you down!"

[when midoriya's hospitalized and everyone learns that his arm's out of commission]
[on his way out, saves Hikage's life from some thugs in the back]

His shoulder would never heal. Midoriya wasn't a stranger to permament damage or anything, but this wasn't his body. To begin with, it didn't make sense that he could give this body an injury that would never heal while trying to save someone.
But Deku-kun, who went through god knows what, had a few scars. Maybe it was the world trying to tell him that his life was a mess. 
But what scared Midoriya the most was how happy it made him feel. It was permament. It was the irrefutable proof, that even if he went back to his world, he did this. This was something he did. 
Wasn't that dispicatable? If (when) he returned, he would need to turn in his Hero Liscense. He clearly wasn't a hero. If all it took for him to break out of that "Hero Ideal" was a new location, then he wasn't a hero at all. 
Passing an alleyway, he found the usual picture. A group of six men ganging up on the last. The man was on the ground.
So what if he kept this hero facade up a little more? Why can't he lie a little longer? What's wrong with it? It's not like there were any heroes here.
Arm in a sling, he stepped into the alleyway and called out.
"If you need six people to beat up one," he said, "then I guess he must be really strong."
It wasn't what a hero would say. Because Midoriya wasn't a hero. 

-

He stared in clear disbelief as Hikage, just a little younger than he remembered, slowly picked his head up. 
"Who... are you?" he asked.
Midoriya stared at him, mouth slowly coming agape.
"Wait, watch out-"
And one of the men that fell came back with a 2x4 and shattered it against his head. It might have knocked someone else, but Midoriya just turned around. 
Staring at him, Midoriya spoke quietly.
"You aren't going to win this fight. Go get first-aid for your friends."
The man stared at him, and took a step back.
"M-Monster..."
He stared for another moment and then smiled.
"Yeah," he said quietly, "That sounds more accurate."

-

"You see," Hikage said, leaning back in his seat, "My quirk is "Danger Sense." It helps me discern dangerous situations."
Midoriya stared at him, unable to tell him that he was intimately aware of that, and took a drink of his water instead.
"And from the moment I met you, it rang like crazy."
His hands trembled on the mug his was holding, and he stared at Midoriya.
"But you saved my life. So I..."
"It's okay," Midoriya said, cutting him off. "It's enough for me that you're okay. You don't have to push yourself."
Was confidence something he never had? Was confidence something that he got because he was a hero? The thought made him feel a little lonely. The quirk that saved Midoriya's life plenty of times was probably an awful burden on a regular someone else. 
Which was funny. To think that he'd ever refer to a former OFA-Holder as a 'regular someone else'.
He stood up, his stomach churning. 
That quirk, that told him when villains were enroaching and that told him that a civilian was being threatened, that quirk was now alerting someone that he was a danger. He couldn't imagine whatkind of headache that they ere receiving, and still, he wanted to meet Midoriya?
That kind of courage was heartening. It made Midoriya remember what he's fighting so hard for.
A hand grabbed his wrist, and the teen jerked. He didn't break out of his grip, and lost his words when he looked up and caught his gaze. Hikage's fingers trembled, and his face was deathly pale.
"But I know you're not a bad person," he said. "I didn't... I always thought that dangerous people were bad. But if you were bad, you wouldn't have helped me, right? No recognition, and no reward, you're-"
"-just a thug," Midoriya cut him off. Just someone that only knows how to talk with my fists. I-"
The grip on his hand tightened.
"Thank you," Hikage interupted again. "For saving me."
"I..."
"When you appeared," Hikage continued, "It was like a scene from a manga! Like... the unlikely hero came to save the day, kind of feeling. I...I-I think I get it now."
Midoriya's eyes widened because no one could have ever prepared him for the next thing that Hikage said.
"I want a protagonist like you!"

-

"Occasionally, I meet a crazy bastard like you," En laughed. "A guy that makes my heart pound and my blood rush."
Midoriya, who had thought that this was an En that came to Japan and never learned Japanese, felt his stomach coil. Wasn't it better that he never heard his voice speak the language he remembered, and that they never had to meet at all if this was how they had to meet?
"When I was first called into Japan, it was because our entire operation here went belly-up. We waited for the pigs to roll somewhere else, and hopped on over to see what happened. You have no idea how upset the bosses were about this! But we couldn't afford failure, so here I am!" he sounded far too happy for a man saddled with a responsibility he didn't want.
Midoriya never had a chance to learn Chinese. He knew phrases and a handful of charactes, but he knew less than the average second-grader. However, he remembered seeing the Chinese strokes and notes before he had to leave. It couldn't be...
"Imagine my shock when I learned that it was some high school brat was the reason why everything crashed and burned. I just had to meet you."
Midoriya stared at him, wary, and En tilted his head. 
"Someone who doesn't flinch when a foreigner approaches him. Who didn't hesitate to help a stranger out and make sure that they get around town. A stranger who could barely understand the person they're helping. Same stranger came running in after my supposed kidnapping into an abandoned warehouse. I would call it reckless but..." he made a motion to the mess of people on the ground. 
Midoriya grimaced. It felt like everyone in this world had a way with words that made him sound like a total loon. But how else could he explain it, other than that he thought that the En needed help?
"Thank you, truly, for coming to save me," En continued, one hand behind his back and his other hand coming forward. "Now, let's fight."
The people in this world only understood one thing.
Midoriya took his jacket off and prepared himself. 

-

"Are... you okay?"
En woke up, a cold compress on his forehead and Midoriya's worried gaze looking down on him. 
"...You hit hard," En said. "Your quirk... Is it strength?"
He shook his head. 
"I see, then, is it... some mind ability? Maybe mind-read? Or predicting the future?"
Green eyes looked to the groundas he backed away.
"I'm quirkless," he said, getting up to his feet. He dusted hmself off, and extended a hand to the taller man, "Do you think you can get up?"
"Yeah, thanks," En said, taking his hand. His hand engulfed Midoriya's, and when he stood up, didn't let go.
"P...Please let go," Midoriya tugged on his hand.
"Hm, I don't want to." En smiled, "Guys like you are once a lifetime. What are your plans for the future, do you want a job with me? I'll take care of you for life."
"No, thank you," Midoriya said, "I'm not going to agree to a job that I might not be qualitifed for."
"There's nothing in the world you're unqualified for. You got the most important part," En replied, "Smart and strong. Compassionate and sucessful."
Midoriya looked like he was going to be sick. It made En chuckle. 
"Here's my card," he said, "Even if you decide not to spend the rest of your life with me, let's be allies."
"What if I want to be strangers?"
En actually laughed, a sound that made him sound like he could fly, before he answered.
"Then you shouldn't have ever given me directions."

-

Midoriya blanched. "What?"
"Yeah, he transferred into class with me," Daiboro replied, "You know him?"
"You're a middle schooler?" Midoriya gasped, hand coming to his face.
With a bow, En beamed back up at him. "And starting next year, I'll be your Kouhai!"

### limited collection

Dabi woke with a start. Suddenly alert, he looked from left to right and then back again. Cold sweat broke out from his brow and down his back as he looked around wildly. There was something wrong. There was something seriously wrong but he couldn't place it. 
"Dabi, you're up already?"
Blue eyes jumped to Midoriya's figure, and he felt the swirling anixeity come in and focus into one point. He stared for a moment and then sighed.
"Bad dream?" Midoriya asked.
Dabi stared back and shrugged. It wouldn't be wrong, he supposed. He didn't even realize when he stopped being used to solitude.
"...What are you up to?" he asked, voice gruff from sleep. 
Midoriya's face darkened, and he looked away. In his hand, he was holding a horned rabbit by the ears. 
"I couldn't sleep," he said, "so I went on a walk. I caught breakfast though."
"Oh, are you going to make the stew?" Dabi asked.
Midoriya's eyes, if at all possible, seemed to grow brighter.
"I can."
Dabi hummed back, feeling as though he had revealed too much about himself. Dragging his eyes away from him, he looked back to their dead fire. There wasn't any warmth left, as though it hadn't been burning so brightly when they had settled in.
"Sounds good."
Midoriya shuffled towards him, a cheeky grin on his face as he sat down next to him with the rabbit. He leaned against his shoulder.
"Sorry I wasn't here when you woke up," he said.
"I don't care," Dabi replied. 
"I really wanted to be the first thing that you saw this morning," he said. 
"...Really?" he tilted his head to the side, and Midoriya gave him a big grin.
"We don't have a house or anything right now, but it sorta feels like it's home when you say "Good morning" to the same person you say "Good night" to, right?"
Dabi wouldn't know, actually, but Midoriya wouldn't know that.
"Good morning, Dabi," he said. "It looks like today will be a beautiful day, too." He got up, probably intending on starting breakfast, when Dabi found his voice.
"Morning," he said. Pointedly, he looked away from Midoriya's bright gaze as he covered his face and spoke ever quieter. "Good... morning."
An hour before sunrise, Dabi felt his face burn as Midoriya giggled behind his hands.
He'd get back at Midoriya for this later. Taking advantage of him when he's still groggy from sleep. 
The realization that he couldn't remember what he dreamed about would come at a later time.

### believe a liar

Supposedly, soulmates are decided by the universe for you. Supposedly. It made Midoriya's heart waver, because there was no clear cut answer for what a soulmate was. Was he supposed to think that all these different people were his 'missing pieces' or whatever?
What a load of bull. At that point, the better question would be to ask would be, "what were the pieces he had?" How many missing pieces did a person have? At that point, didn't it make more sense to say that he wasn't even a person? 
But that trail of thought led to even more dangerous thoughts.
He covered his face.
Back up, take a breath. The decision he was about to make was going to ruin someone. He needed to make the correct decision, not the one that made him feel good. Between eternal summer blues and dawn's vibrant reds, a pull on his heart and the pain in his gut, he had to make a choice. 
Thinking of it like that, he felt like it was easy. The only person, people, he could be with were the ones that wouldn't break because he did. 
Therefore, Yamada-sensei and Aizawa-sensei were the right option. They lived without him just fine before. They would be fine without him too. It would be fine. He curled a little tighter around himself, and wondered what he would need to do to express his gratitude to them.
