### apoc

Deku stared at his empty cupboards. This was bad. He had no food left. He tilted his head to the side. Unike many of the others, he hadn't xperienced staratin. Obviously, he was responsible about his intake, and made sure to ration everything he had, but he had never experienced a starvation that had him laying on his side, waiting for death. 
Crossing his arms over his chest, he thought about it. If he went downstairs right now and took some food, whose hand was he taking from? Then, the thought made his stomach twist and he shook the thought from his head.
How could he take from someone when it wasn't that he wasn't that hungry? He once read in a book that people would die of starvation in about two weeks. Which meant that he only really needed to eat once a week, if that. 
In Deku's head, it made logical sense.
He grabbed his bat and turned to leave. If he kept working, he wouldn't have the time to be hungry, or so his thought process went.
As soon as he left his apartment, however, he smelled it. Fresh rice. The smell came from downstairs, and before he knew what he was doing, he was at the residentual common area where the others were. 
"Hel-Helmet-san?"
That name again. That Helmet. Who could it be?
"Helmet-san, do you want to eat?"
Yes, he wanted to say. Please feed Helmet-san, whoever it was. Because anyone that could make Mr Compres stand up and approach him, anyone that made Shigaraki sit up and anyone that could silence the room with just his name, was someone that sounded important to someone else. 
Not him. He understood that. Standing in that room, he could see the faces of the people that, if he ate, he would be taking the food from. He couldn't do that. 
Deku, who smelled of rot no matter how hard he scrubbed, realized that with his pressence, the delicious smell of rice would rot. Right, he remembered. He didn't belong here, with these people. 
Turning on his heel, he left the room before he deluded himself any longer. 
Work hard, Deku, he told himself. He had to work hard because that was all he could do.

-

Deku swung and swung. 
He stopped to grab a few IDs.
Then he got up and swung and swung.
He stopped when there was nothing left to swing at. Bodies littered the ground and his steps were sticky from drying blood. Was he empty because he was hungry? Was he empty because he had nothing left to hit? Standing silently, he wondered if this was his limit. That he would never, could have never been a hero, because this was his upper limit and heroes didn't have an upper limit. 
The thought came around his neck like a noose. It tightened the longer he thought about it, and when he stopped thinking about it for the moment, it rested heavily on his shoulders. 
Something broke and Deku pulled his bat back up and waited.
Instead of an enemy, a frantic-looking Aizawa stared back at him. The man stared at the bodies, and then back to Deku.
If this man came to kill him, Deku would deserve it. If this man came to hurt him, he wouldn't fight it. Deku would welcome it. 
And since he was a coward, he would be thankful that he didn't have to live anymore. 
Instead, probably because Aizawa was a smart man who understood so much more about the world than Midoriya could ever dream of understanding, Aizawa didn't hurt him and didn't kill him.
Because Deku didn't deserve to get away so easily. He understood that in his head, even if his arms felt so tired that he couldn't lift them to wash his face some nights. 

-

Deku couldn't do anything right. It's why he was known as Deku. And anyone else, they might have found a better way to do it.
"H-Hel... Helmet?"
Deku picked his head up, and visually checked that Shigaraki was alive and breathing. Good. His hands trembled from the weight of the damn shelf on them, but he was glad that Shigaraki was okay. 
The dressar filled with expensive china had tipped over, but he managed to spare Shigaraki from taking the brunt of the fall. It hurt Midoriya, so he only imagined how it would have hurt Shigaraki.
After all, all the pain he took was pain that someone else was spared from, and all that. 
He looked to the side, was there enough room for Shigaraki to get out.
"Y-You're so damn stupid."
Shigaraki's hand came flat against the cabienent, and it all dissolved. "You forget that I can do that?" he asked. "I can't believe you. Are-Doesn't that hurt?"
As soon as it was gone, Deku was back on his feet. If Shigaraki was wagging his tongue, then he must be fine. Deku, on the other hand, wanted to keep moving. His back ached. He needed to keep moving, or else he was scared that his arms and legs would lock up and he would be useless. He just needed to keep moving.
"Wha-What the hell do you think I am?!" 
Something grabbed his arm, and all Deku could think in that moment was that someone was coming for his life. He swung his other arm, bat in hand to hit whatever was coming for him, and his eyes widened when he saw Shigaraki. The older man, however, released him nad backed away several feet. 
They stared at each other for a second longer before Deku turned back forward, embareesed that he had swung at someone who he wanted to protect. Idiot, he told himself. Be more aware of your surroundings.
Behind him, he'd never know what Shigarki's expression was, or what it meant. 

-

After sleeping against the wall for the night, Deku's back hurt even more. From what he could see while craning his neck in front of a mirror, his shoulder and upper back were a nasty purple. He stared at it and sighed. His entire back was tingly, down to his elbows and his knees. 
Well, he could still move, so he supposed that he would be fine. If this was something that could kill him, he should have died a long time ago. Heatened by that thought, he grabbed his things and prepared to head out. There were too many things for him to sit and mope about a few bruises after all. 
He reached for a trail mix, and paused. He wasn't actually hungry. He ate yesterday, after all. And it wasn't like he was tired, so he better keep moving.
With the hope that even he could be useful, he closed the door behind him and almost immediately, there was a gust of wind. Sitting on the rails, wings outstretched behind him, Hawks looked at him with a wide grin. 
"Yo, Helmet. Going somewhere?"
His backpack dug into his shoulder. With every step, it jostled and rubbed against the skin there, pressing down on the swelling mess of his shoulder. If he breathed too deeply, it felt like something was grinding down against it.
However, when he saw Hawks, who looked like he was starting to fit into his clothes and his brilliant red wings, stretched out and no longer patchy, he could forget it all. He wasn't hungry. He wasn't hurt. He wasn't tired.
He was fine.

-

It was a strange thing to forget. The thought that they did forget didn't even occur to them until they were reminded of it. The aggressive, almost violent way that Deku carried himself was as terryfying as it was awe-inspiring.

-

"...Can you do something about it?" Dabi asked.
Chisaki nodded, "I could."
"Please," Dabi tacked on. 
"...Your patches," Chisaki said, "are a result of your piss-poor control over your quirk, isn't it?"
Dabi nodded his head, but didn't answer. 
"So, if I do this for you, aren't you just going to return because you still can't control your quirk? Did you really learn anything from then to now? Since you're a villain, I doubt it. None of you seem to even know what self-control means."
Dabi set his jaw, and slowly found his words again.
"...You're right," he said, "I'll probably ask this of you a few more times."
Chisaki's eyes were chilling, like they didn't fit on a lving person, but a statue. Impassive and cold. 
"But for those few times, I'll make sure that Helmet returns alive."
Their eyes met. 
"...Well said," Chisaki said, taking his glove off and stepping towards him. "This will hurt," he warned.
It should be stupid, how easy it was for people to agree once you mentioned a specific person. A glaring weakness, probably. 

-

"Yeah, yeah, morn..."
There was a brief pause before Midnight pointed at his face and said, "Oh. Who's that?"
But Dabi didn't care about that. He leaned back and waited for one person.
Taking a deep breath, unsure if he wanted change or if he didn't, he raised his hand and spoke up.
"Morning," he said, straightening, "Helmet."
Did he notice that he wasn't scarred? Did he notice that his fire had returned? That he got rid of anymore distractions? This was it. This was his proof. His face and entire body was proof.
Dabi wasn't someone that lived for revenge anymore, but something else. 
"That's Dabi?" Shigaraki gasped, next to Helmet. "God, what happened to your face?"
On the other side of Helmet, Hawks whistled. "Chisaki-san really outdid himself."
And Helmet walked right past him, as he always did, as he always would have. It brought relief and disappointment to Dabi in equal measures. 
Feeling like a child, who changed his hairstyle in hopes that it would catch his crush's eye, he rubbed the back of his neck, buried his disappointment, and fell into step.

-

"Deku!" Hawks' flew right next to him, and landed safely on the ground. With a wide grin, he turned around so that he could face Deku as they walked down the sidewalk. "What a coincidence, meeting you here," he said, shameless and radiant. 
The man didn't reply, not that Hawks was expecting him to.
"Hey, have you eaten yet? Let's eat together, if you haven't." and he was about 99% sure that Deku hadn't eaten, because he had a feather on him all day, and also because he was pretty much side-by-side with him since Deku left the apartment sometime the night before.
With the sun setting next to them, Hawks was starting to get pretty hungry. 
"C'mon, let's go eat whatever leftovers they got." Which was also bullshit, because he knew that Lunchrush would rise from wherever he was to make Deku something to eat. Hell, Hawks would learn how to cook if it meant that Deku would eat something. 
"I ate," he replied, surprising him. "So go ahead."
"You did?" the blond stared back, shocked that he had missed that. "When?"
The young man nodded and replied, "Monday."
The gears shifted in Hawks head.
"Today's... Wednesday."
Deku nodded again.
And Hawks grabbed him by the shoulders, his heart thundering in his ears.
"Deku, do you... only eat on Mondays?"
He nodded.
And suddenly, the fact that the weekends were dedicated to cleaning and staying on base, and that the hardest travels were always on Mondays and Tuesdays made too much sense. Sometimes, the answer to his questions was something that made the world unsteady underneath his feet, and his wings too heavy to take flight.
"That's... not good," he said. "In fact, that's really, really bad."
"It's okay," Deku replied, eyebrows furrowed as he tlted his head. "I'm used to it."
And Hawks, who never forgot how that canned chicken tasted after he flew in the dark for days and nights, with only those Christmas Lights as his North Star,  felt nauseous. 
"It's not... You shouldn't be..." his words failed him. His heart pounded in his chest, as though he hadn't felt enough pain without his heart actively trying to bruise his breastbone. "Let's eat. You and me. Right now."
Because he didn't know how to explain that people needed to eat every day. That Deku was already too small, already too young, already too important for Hawks to think that this was anything resemlbing "okay."
"I don't need to-"
"Do you think that I eat too much?" Hawks asked, because he wasn't going to let this go. Even if it was through dirty means, and he had to overwhelm Deku, or even knock him out and carry him away, he didn't want tolet this go any further. He took a step forward, and Deku, who never hesitated to run into a fight, took a step back.
"...N-no," he said, "You should eat when you're hungry."
"And you?" Hawks asked, "Deku, is there anyone here who you think eats too much?"
He shook his head. 
"Then you too," he said, "You should eat with us too."
Deku hesitated and Hawks tried not to despair. Did it make sense? There were groups that fell apart due to limited resources and fighting for another bite of food. Hawks watched it happen. All through that however, was Deku, who never said no to a hungry stomach, but never thought to feed himself. 
"I'm okay," he replied back, eyebrows furrowed as he stared back at him. "I'm not hungry."
Hawks' expression tightened. 
"Deku, I-I really think you should eat something. It's not good to be hungry all the time. You should..." his words trailed, and he felt at a loss.
There was no way to make Deku do anything. He knew. He's tried. This would be no different, he was certain, but that didn't make it any easier for him. He couldn't let this continue.
"We have plenty of food," he said, "We do. Please, you of all people should know that."
His grip tightened, and he could feel Deku tensing under his grip. Still, the young man didn't break out, even though it would have been easy to. He didn't know what that meant, but Hawks couldn't think straight as he spoke firmly instead.
"Even if it's just a bite, please, let's eat together. Eating is more than the food and the taste, you know? Being together helps with morale, and it builds bonds between each other. It-It's not just about the food. So please. I-"
There had to be something he could say, something he could do that Deku would understand. 
"Please come and eat something, anything, with me."
"...Okay."
The blond blinked. That's it? If all he had to do was grovel and beg, that was easy. That was chump change. He would do all that and more, if it was for the too-thin man in front of him.
"...What?"
"I'll come. Please don't cry."
Cry?
Hawks took a step back and rubbed at his eyes. What the fuck?
Well, if this was what it took, then who cared? It wasn't like Hawks cared about his reputation or image at this point.

- 

"We are working on a vaccine!" she shouted out. "Please! We are trying to find a way for people to turn back!"
"If you kill what bit you," Dabi spoke up, "You don't turn."
There was a long silence. 
"I... what?"
"And if you kill all the monsters, then eventually, all the people will turn back. Or die, if their body can't keep up."
Dabi tilted his head.
"Not a lot of Big Brain energy, huh? Scientist-sensei."

> post 5 yr:

"Infiltrate and report back."
Tokuda had seen a lot of things in his life, and took picutres of almost all of them. Needless to say, he never thought he'd become a spy of any sort. Coming to the most blood-thirsty group among all the survivors was not high up in his to-do list, but in a group filled with Pro-Heroes and Hero Comission members, everyone had to do their part.
And, a part of him that had heard whispers that All Might (among several other high-profile heroes) wanted to see how far his hero had fallen. Was the apocalpyse something that could even ruin the Symbol of Peace? It must be.
After all, All Might stayed with the survivor group marked by the corpses they burned and the plume of smoke caused in conjunction to that.
As expected of the group of barbarians, Tokuda and the people he came with were caught and tossed on the ground. His chin dug into the ground, knees bruising at the awful treatment on his old bones, but kept his mouth shut to observe the situation at hand insted. 
"Four, huh?" 
"...Should we just kill them?" one of the younger children (and Tokuda felt nauseous at the sight of such a young face with a weapon. They were children, literal children, no taller than his waist, and he had a gun) asked.
"Kouta, you're spending way too much time with Stain," an older teen replied. He ran his hand through blond locks. "Iida already left to make the report. So let's sit tight for now."
The kid, Kouta, didn't reply but kept his gun drawn. Both hands were on it, and from his posture, it was clear that he had some proper training, and didn't trust them for anything, but begrudingly listened. 
"Got the report, thanks for catching them alive," a voice came from above and Hawks descended quickly. He looked from the blond with the bad dye-job to the child and waved. "Good work."
The kid took this as his cue to get up and leave, but the teen straightened and didn't otherwise leave. 
The winged-hero turned over to the side. 
"H-Hawks-san!"
Bingo, Tokuda thought. Because the members of the Hero Commision made it clear that more than anyone else, Hawks would be most likely to return to them. They said not to bother with Endeavor or All Might, because the fact that they allowed this told them enough. But Hawks and some of the lower ranking heroes might be stuck between a rock and a hard place.
In that sense, Tokuda and the others would be providing them an escape route. Of course, among these savages, it might take some convincing and a promise to save everyone eventually, but they just needed to remind Hawks (and maybe some of the other heroes) of who he really was, and what they used to fight for. A world with justice and freedom, where people could live peacefully in society. And at their base, that might just happen. 
And, this was Tokuda's personal agenda, he wanted to see what really happened with All Might.
Hawks stepped in front of them, eyes peircing. "You guys alright?"
"H-Hawks-san!" the man next to him, Miura, cheered. "W-what's going on? We were just making our way through when these-these savages attacked us for no reason!"
"Ah, we're just paraoid," Hawks said, "Dealt with some bad shit before."
Tokuda frowned. He didn't doubt it, but there was something about the way that  he said that. Tokuda narrowed his eyes.
"Just because we're keeping you alive right now doesn't mean we'll keep doing that, you know?" 
His smile was kind, anything that they could have seen off of bilboards and in advertisements. But several years living in these conditions must have unhinged him. 
Well, Tokuda figured that it shouldn't have been that easy to begin with. 
"This is Hawks reporting in," Hawks said, hand pulling his walkie to his mouth to speak. "We got four survivors. Didn't put up much of a fight."
"Just kill them all," the call returned, and Tokuda broke out in sweats. Next to him, the people with him didn't seem to take it any better.
"Shut up, Dabi," Hawks replied, light-heartedly like it was just a funny joke. He turned to meettheir eyes, that easy-smile on his face not once slipping, "You made them all scared."
"Hawks, this is HQ," a woman's voice sounded through the walkie, "Go ahead and bring them back to base. Alive and intact."
"Yes ma'am," he replied back, sounding lazy as he looked to the group, "We'll be right there." A few feathers came to their side, easily picking them up in haphazadous ways, and Tokuda felt nauseous as he watched the ground get further away. "Don't bite your tonuge," Hawks called out. "Kaminari-kun, I'll be heading back first."
"Have a safe trip."
"Don't get left behind again," the blond said with a laugh.

-

Tokuda wasn't sure what he was expecting from their base of operations. To his understanding, he knew that it used to be where an apartmnet stood, but they had torn it down to rebuild a fortress of their own. Looking at it, however, he was reminded of a time when the world didn't smell so much like blood. 
What a beautiful building.
"Oh wow," Miura whispered out. "This is the base of savages?"
Tokuda kicked him in the leg. What's wrong with him? Did getting caught scramble up his brains or something? 
"Hawks-san, welcome back!"
They were unceremonously dropped onto the ground, and Hawks landed in front of him. His wings folded back as he gave a lazy wave at the person that called for him. 
"Yeah, I'm back. How're things, Ingenium?"
Tokuda startlted, and indeed, it was Ingenium. It was strange not seeing him with a helmet, but he looked bright. 
"Same old," Ingenium replied. "We got four on our side. Todoroki-kun will be handling the rest of it before heading back in." He looked around the blond, "And these are the survivors?"
"Yep. Fascinating, aren't they?"


-

Tokuda frowned. Where did this feather come from? His mind thought back to Hawks, his bright red wings, and wondered if it had gotten caught on his sweater or something.

"It's worth it," Ban Yeoryung cried. She wiped at her eyes and rubbed them hard, even red-rimmed, they were breathtaking. Fat tears ran down her face and the words came out strangled, and still, she was beautiful. "It doesn't hurt. I can do it."
"...Yeoryung?" Dan-i whispered back. As the main lead, she supposed it wouldn't be this easy.
"I'll protect it. The world where-where we eat ice cream together. The world where we s-sleep next to each other. I'll do it," she said. "I'll protect the world that I share with my Dan-i."
Dan-i, on occasion, wondered what had happened in their past, that this beautiful woman was so loyal to her. The original Ham Dan-i must have been someone equally beautiful to have earned that loyalty. 
"Yeo-ryung," she said, collecting her hands, and smiled. "Having you here is enough for me." She leaned in, pushing her long hair behind her ear, and grinned. "Every day I get to spend with you is my most precious treasure."
