>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

Dabi felt a weight suddenly lean against him and he froze. His eyes darted to the side, and indeed, Deku's head was against his arm. 
His eyes stared at the young man, frozen stiff where he was.
"Deku," he said quietly. He didn't want to wake the young man, he always looked so exhausted, but he also didn't want the man to sleep on him like this.
In front of him, Mina walked in with a folded map, no doubt finished with her quick patrol, when she caught the two of them. She looked at Deku, then Dabi, then back, and then gave a ferocious grin.
She gave Dabi a wide grin, a big thumbs up, turned around and left.
That bitch. Asshole. Fucking help him.
And unable to move even an inch in any direction, he sat stiffly. Cursing long and hard in his head, he couldn't believe those hero-wannabe assholes.
They should have at least left their jacket so Deku had a blanket. With a forlorn sigh, he looked again at Deku, sleeping with his chin to his chest, and wished the young man could sleep more comfortably. 
He's never met Deku when he was cranky from lack of sleep. A part of him didn't want to see it, but the rest of him wouldn't mind seeing. 
Well, whatever. 
He leaned back slowly, careful not to jostle the young man. He was sensitive to everything. 
Tired, he closed his eyes, figuring that nothing would happen to him as long as Deku was next to him. Just for a moment, he thought. He was tired.

"Where's-"
"Sh!"
Enji, while he was privately glad that the others were a little more comfortable with him, felt mildly annoyed at the fact that he had just been shushed. 
But Mina smiled up at him, bright-eyed and she motioned him closer with a hushed, "Look at them!"
Enji peered over, and saw the way Dabi's head leaned on top of Deku's. The way Deku slept against Dabi's arm, mouth slightly open. Their hands rested against each other, palm to palm, Deku's arm crossing over Dabi's, and otherwise looking comfortable.
Staring at them, Enji felt a surge of pride.
Peace, he thought. All their hard work and effort had accumulated to a single moment. Everything they had done, for these 15 minutes. Eventually, it would be more. It would be much more.
"Let them rest," he said. As long as he they needed to.
Enji would protect it. What he couldn't protect before, what he didn't realize what was important before, he would be certain to protect it now.

Deku jumped up to grab the top of the railing, a manuever that he's done before, and swung his legs up. As he did so, the railing creaked and snapped. 
Oh shit, he thought. 
Four floors up, the ground looked mighty far from where he was. Right when he thought that, there was a rush of wind and he was watching the railing clatter to the ground.
"Can't take my eyes off of you for a second," Hawks said, arms tight around Deku, under his arms and around his waist, hoisting the man so that they were eye-level. "Well, it's not near

"Shigaraki Tomura," Kurogiri said, and for a guy who was all smoke, he was extrodinarily good at expression his displeasure just by saying Shigaraki's name, "Why is your clothing so tight?"
And Shigaraki, whose pants were clinging and up to his shins, button broken and ripped open, hoodie a tight crop top that he ripped the back and shoulder of getting it over his chest. Aside from the catcalls he got and some gasps, Shigaraki felt like he was breaking all the wrong laws.
"Fuck off," he said, walking through.
"There is a sudden increase of Pro-Heroes in the area, exercise better caution-"
Shigaraki walked right by him, slamming the door behind him and Kurogiri sighed. Sensei didn't seem particularly interested if Shigaraki could use his quirk or not, explaining that he could have everything and more soon enough, and Kurogiri didn't care if Sensei didn't.
He stared at his impeccably clean bar, not a speck of dust, since Shigaraki returned with missing fingers. Sensei it was good that he was gaining independence, but according to the day-drama that Kurogiri watched, he knew that a girl must be involved. Was this little friend aware of who he was? What he was trying to do?
Was she the reason why his recent behavioral patterns had changed?
Kurogiri needed a little more information, then he would be certain. Surely, Giran would have a good recommendation for a reliable investigator to garner some more information.

>> hires chimera & co? in exchange, Kurogiri covers the cost for Nine's sugery/experiment thing?

"Augh, this is such a waste of time," he sighed.

Two days later...

"Kid's got like, ten people coming in and out of his house-"
"Yeah, but four of them are like his teachers-"
"And you wouldn't believe-"
Chimera cut them off, "Which ones?" he asked, remembering the feeling of Midoriya's scarred fingers running through his fur. 
He paused, and when he didn't get a response, glared at the other two.
"Well?"
"...I thought you did stakeouts too," Scissor said. "Shouldn't you know?"
"It's not like you're one of them, right?"
There was a pause when Chimera didn't answer.
"Chimera," Scissor gasped, scandalized but there was a bright gleam in her eyes and a smile starting to stretch her lips. "Should we be expecting a new addition to the team?"
"Uh," their current youngest hesitated, "He's a literal kid. On his way to being a hero. No?"
"You don't want to be called "senpai"?"
And Chimera couldn't wait for Nine to wake up and then whip all of them in gear, because he honest to god was considered it.
"Well, I guess it wouldn't be so bad."

"...I don't know," Midoriya said, "how to take responsibility for my actions. I-I know that I have to face consequences, but I don't... I don't think it'll be enough."
Dabi laughed, a bitter sound that would hurt much more than his fire could.
"What a pretty way of saying that you don't want to do anything. You don't know how to, so you don't bother, but you sound like you're putting your best forward, right?"


-

"...I feel like we haven't eaten lunch together in a while," Iida explained. "I... I hope everything is okay. And regardless if it is or not, I," he hesitated, and the normally impeccable Iida looked like a teenager, lost and stumbling just like Midoriya did.
"We just want you to know we are here for you!" Uraraka called out, her hands clenched into fists and a grin on her face.

"But you have a teacher!" Monoma shouted, "You have a teacher and even All Might favors you!" His hand came to his hair, tugging at it and he screamed out. "Don't take Kan-sensei from us!"
And Midoriya had forgotten that it went both ways. The time he took from a villain, ensuring that only one person would be hurt, was the same as the
