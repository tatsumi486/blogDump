There were a lot of things that Midoriya had to do today. They were going to clear out the parking garage of the strip mall, testing the roof of the houses, running checks on the water, things like that. Lots to do. He was going to finish with his lesson in Edo-era policies and head out. 
"Hey, be my mate."
Midoriya looked up at Shigaraki, really squinted at him, and then looked out the window. The sky is in fact, above the ground. A bright blue with small, wispy clouds floating on by. He looked back at Shigaraki.
"You don't mean that."
"Be my mate."
The shock quickly wore off as his Midoriya's eyes sharpened with his temper. If Shigaraki thought he could be intimidated, he had another thing-
"Please."
No, it would turn out that Shigaraki just didn't know how to ask.
"No," Midoriya said.
"..I'll ask again next year," the alpha said, "Because I don't think I'll change my mind in a year."
Green eyes closed as he took a long sigh.
"I don't even know where to begin with you," he said. "What does being a mate even mean to you?"
Shigaraki raised his eyebrow, "That we do eechi things."
"We can do eechi things without mating," Midoriya shot back. 
Both of Shigaraki's eyebrows hiked up his face, "Will we? Can we?" His eyes dropped to Midoriya's lips, darkening in color.
"If I did, would you drop this?"
He leaned back, when Shigaraki started to lean in too close. It seemed to break the older man out of his trance. 
"I don't know," he replied, turning around so that Midoriya was facing his back. "I've never wanted someone like this."

"You're an S-Ranker," Touya said, four parts frustrated and one part desperate, "You can do anything you want. It would be a waste of resources and human life to try and make you do anything, so you don't have to listen to anyone. Just do what you want to do!"
"...Any... anything?" Midoriya asked, his voice so quiet that it sounded like it would blow away like a candle.
Touya's shoulder slumped as he nodded. "Yeah. Anything."
"Like... eating chocolate before breakfast?"
Touya stared at Midoriya for a long moment. He fell back into his seat, placed his head in hands and took a long, suffered sigh.
"Yeah," he said, pulling his head up to stare at Midoriya, just as exasperated and tired, "like eating chocolate before breakfast."
"Wow..." Midoriya covered his mouth with his hands, a thousand stars in his eyes. "That's... really powerful."
Touya gave him a weak smile in return. 
"We'll start here," he sighed.

Spinner stepped in front of Midoriya, eyes narrowed. It was laughable to just about anyone, that some C-Rank Tanker would step in front of any S-Ranker to protect them, but Midoriya seemed to shrink into Spinner's shadow.
"And you are?"
"Ah, sorry about that," the man said, rubbing the back of his head sheepishly. He brandished out a business card. "Here, I am Hitakino from Tokyo Live. I called earlier about an interview with Midoriya-sama."
Even though it was the correct title, hearing someone call him that, call him '-sama' like that, made Spinner's skin crawl. That look in his eyes wasn't something that used those kinds of titles because they respected the person. 
He stayed in front of Midoriya, because Midoriya could take down any monsters but faltered at the sight of human beings. The way regular people feared monsters, Midoriya shied from humans. Spinner could not protect him from threats like monsters as well as he wanted to, but he wouldn't dare let any human harm Midoriya.

When people see hunters flinch, they scoff. When lightning flashes and a barrier forms immediately around them, an unmistakable, translucent green, people laugh at Midoriya. This young child does not know better, and still flinches at flashes at lightning.
They don't think about how long a hunter has been in a dungeon. They don't think about how those instincts and quick response is what makes sure that all the hunters return home. They don't think about those kinds of things. They just see Midoriya, who was small for his age, swimming in Dabi's sweater and reacting to lightning storms with a barrier that had no place next to civilians.
"Ahaha..." he gave a sheepish laugh, dissipating the magic with a wave of his hand as nearby civilians wag their finger at him and sigh in disappointment. 
And the hunters-anyone that had any sense of magic, actually- recoiled at the sheer amount of mana that expelled out of the air in an instant.
In these occations, Sero couldn't help but be a little jealous of regular people, who wouldn't know what they couldn't feel.

In hunter society, there was a given. It was an unspoken law that none could challenge, and consistent all around the world. Regardless of class, wealth, race, religion or sex, there was one truth about hunter society. 
The strong ruled.
People could challenge the strong, people could try and chase after them, people could even try to kill them. If they die or they lose, then they have a new Strongest. The person at the top may change, but the system does not. 
Still, standing as the strongest was the same person for the last five years.
"Touya, did you know that otters hold hands when they swim together?"
"Really?" Touya replied back as he tapped his pen to the paper. "That's pretty cute." No gate financing paperwork was more important than the conversation at hand.
"Right? Do you think they have any at the zoo?"
Behind Dabi, someone started to make calls and furiously started to type on their computer. Amaetuer. They should have done that from the moment Midoriya mentioned otters. No doubt, a big special on otters will be showing soon.
"Probably. You wanna go?"
A seat next to him, Shirakumo's phone started to buzz like mad. The blond gave Touya a strained smile, one that Touya returned with a lazy grin. 
"Un!" Midoriya nodded, eyes bright and Touya started to reorganize their entire schedule for the following week and a half. 
No doubt, while touring the zoo, Midoriya would find something or anothe. The Raid Party would have to be updated to accomodate whatever or whereever that Midoriya wanted to go. Preparations for transporation and the likes would have to beorganized. Since they were going to go out, Touya was going to have to check on nearby food places and keep tabs on which one that Midoriya stared at the longest. Changes for the business dealings for the dragon-scales would have to be transferred to someone else, or altogether rescheduled. 
And all in all, Touya was gladthat Midoriya wasn't as whimsical assome of the other S-Rankers he heard about. If he firmly put his foot down and said, no, Midoriya, he would listen. He would listen, but that would be wronged.
The strongest ruled. It was only right that Midoriya got what he wanted. 

<->

"Well, a hunter without gates is just a NEET."
Spinner opened his mouth. Closed it. 
"Damn," he eventually said. 

<->

"I'm not in the mood for fried chicken," Midoriya said, shaking his head. "You can eat it though."
Hawks face fell. His last line of defense came crumbling. As expected of an S-Rank Hunter.
"Nah, we don't need it. What... What do you want to eat?"
"I'm not really hungry."
Hawks wanted to argue,

When Midoriya was six and had a loose understanding that marriage occured between two people deeply in love, he learned of his father's Other Family.
