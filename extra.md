Izumi's dad sat down next to him, and hand on his back, rubbed circles. The gesture was so warm, so sudden, and so unexpected that Izuku froze where he was. The moment felt like a lie.
"I know I'm hard on you," he said. "I'm pushing you this hard because..." his voice trailed and then he sighed. 
Why are you here? Izuku wanted to ask. Your daughter is indoors. He almost reminded him.
"...When I was a kid, my parents didn't push me to do anything. They loved me, of course, and I was raised with an abudance of love and care. Really, the most spoiled guy you would find on the block. I didn't get it at the time, but now that I'm older with kids of my own, I think I really wanted them to care. I want you to eat your vegetables because I know it's good for you. I want you to go and finish school so that you can do something with your life. I want you to live your life, and look back to these moments and think that these were the hardest moments of your life."
Izuku felt his hands tremble.
"I'm sorry, but really and truly Izuku. I love you. I never not loved you. If I could, I would tell you to just do whatever you want and not worry about anything but I... Your dad didn't do a good job growing up, so I can't give you that."
"...But Izumi-"
"But nothing. You are you," he said. 
Izuku stared, feeling as though he was finally standing on solid ground instead of floating off in someone else's orbit. He wondered if this was how Newton felt when that apple bopped him in the head, or it this was how Copernicus felt when faced with the radical notion of a heliocentric universe, because in that second, it felt like Izuku was talking to Izuku's dad. 
Bizzare. Strange. A ridiculous notion that made no sense. If this was brought to court, tried and compred with data and evidence, it would bring riots. It would...
"Your mom and I didn't have any siblings growing up. So I'm sorry that I made mistakes like comparing two completely different people together or anything like that. Izuku, you have always been Izuku."
Izuku was left sitting there. The tears didn't come, but he felt like something inside of him had hollowed out. 
Relief, he thought, didn't feel like fucking anything.



### withering

"I'm not," Twice shook his head, rocking back and forth with Midoriya in his arms, "I'm not strong enough to-to send you away. I'm not, I'm not-"
And Midoriya, who was nothing if the stars to his night and the sugar to his candy, leaned his head against his chest and laughed.
"It's not about strength," he said. "Anyone can say goodbye."
The blond trembled, twice as big as Midoriya and a quarter of his strength.
"You don't have to be strong all the time, Jin," he explained.

Midoriya stared, mouth agape like an idiot, and Chisaki looked down at him.
"Is your quirk not good for combat?" he asked. "Or the type to attract trouble? It would appear that we keep meeting under these unfortunate circumstances."
Midoriya wiped at the blood under his nose and shivered. Just a nosebleed, but he was acting like he lost a pint. When someone lost enough blood, they experience the cold. Midoriya understood that and stil tried to will it all away. 
Luckily, there was a handsome man in front of him to focus on instead. He looked up at him, enjoyed the aesthetic of a man in a sharp suit standing underneath the flickering streetlights. It was like the light was his life, flickering in and out as though it was holding onto life just to made this man shine.
"If... I had a quirk," Midoriya said slowly, "that'd be a great quirk, if it meant that we kept meeting."
He made a show of looking from Chisaki's feet and up to his face. Instead of the usual disgust, however, the look on his face wasn't something that he had seen before.
"You're quirkless?" he asked, voice so quiet that Midoriya could hear the flickering light of the streetlamp over them.
"Ah..." Midoriya gave himself away. Shit. 
He looked at his hands, and took a deep breath. People were such strange creatures, he really had no idea what they would say or do when they learn about his quirk or lackthereof until the second they learn that he doesn't have one. Would it be disbelief? Would he feel like it was infectious? That, just by being in the same breathing room, his quirk would suddenly and magically disappear just because he was with someone who was quirkless. 
"...I told you," he said, "Not to meet me again."
"Then," Chisaki's fingers kept an iron grip on Midoriya's chin, as though to anchor him to this point, but his lips as soft as flower petals and brushed against Midoriya's lips with the grace of a painter, "shall we meet only in your dreams?"
His eyes were bright, a yellow so vibrant that he could believe the sun had never set, and his heart pounded. Midoriya lost his breath, and the older man's lips curled up.
"But surely, you wouldn't condemn me to a fate like that, would you?"
He took a step back and pulled something out of his pocket. A small piece of paper that he fold in half. He kneeled down in front of Midoriya, and dropped gloved fingers onto the buckle of his pants. Carefully, in contrast to the way he had been treating him before, Chisaki tucked the piece of paper into the front of his pants. Crouched in front of him, his hands moved to rest, palm down and fingers stretched out, and ran them down Midoriya's thighs.
"Until next time."
Above, as though to regoznie that Chisaki was leaving and there was nothing worth shining light over anymore, the streetlamp died and their alleyway was plunged into darkness.
Long after Chisaki was gone (and Midoriya had no recollection on how he got home but he did), his lips were still tingly. 
The piece of paper had several numbers on it.


### way back home

"I thought about it," Midoriya said. "But you know, when I think about you, I don't feel tired at all."
He wiped at his chin, catching the last bit of sweat at his chin, and then cleared his throat. 
He gave a grin, nervous and uncertain because circumstances were hard, but they weren't impossible. 
"Ready?"

Rody closed his eyes, and with glaring clarity, he remembered a kid who beat him up and also carried him to the hospital on the back. He remembered the warmth of his small back, and wondered how someone so small could be so strong when all he did was run and run and run.
"...It starts here," he muttered. 
He knocked on the door. A long time ago, all he talked about was planes. He still had them, stacks and stacks of books about fighter planes and regular planes and old planes and plane engines and everything from helicopters to passenger planes and for a long time, it was too hard to even look at them. 
But there was someone who wanted to be somtething even more impossible than what he wanted from the world. There was someone that wanted to be something that didn't even exist outside of bad storybooks and B-Action flicks. He wanted to be it, and Rody believed that if anyone could be a hero in this shitty world, it would be...
"Dad?"
So him too. Rody wanted to do something more than just this. Rody wanted to do what everyone said he can't. Rody wanted to do it and soar above everyone else in the entire world and let them all see it.
Rody was going to build a plane and fly it around the world. 
"There's sometihng I want to talk to you about..."
He wondered how it was possible that the person that believed him and his stupid dream when he was six and dumber wasn't him or his dad or his family or any of his guys, but a stranger who didn't know how to stay out of other people's business.

### apoc

Oh lord, Deku thought, his mouth running dry and his eyes widening comically. 
Pro-Hero Endeavor was so damn big. He was huge. He was even bigger in life than he was in interviews and in posters and everything. Deku felt so pitifully small, like wasn't even worth even standing in his gaze, with his bloodstained hands and his maggot-infested clothes.
Well, concerning how much nothing he was, there was no way that Endeavor even noticed him, after all. 
Still, just being in the same room as him (and you don't understand Endeavor never did fan-events or anything so when would Deku ever have the chacneto even look at him or stand in the same 4 meter radius as him oh no he must smell awful and look even worse), had his heart beating so loudly that he couldn't hear anything else. 
And those eyes, a summer blue that made his mouth run dry, stared at him. Or rather, stared in his direction. He couldn't imagine that Endeavor would ever look at him, when there were so many other real and important things that probably required his attention.
"... should I do?" 
Deku almost jerked, because he didn't even realize that the man was talking to someone. How rude he must have been! Deku could hardly believe it. Being dazzled by someone as radiant as Endeavor was no excuse to stand in the hallway, to stand in the way of this very-important man. Flustered, because anxiety and social recluseness was not a reasonable excuse to waste Endeavor's time.
On top of that, he was shamelessly eavesdropping on a conversation. Of course, he had no recollection of anything that had been said,
