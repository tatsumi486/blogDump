### kind nightmare
[ villain -> hero 
 dabi -> endeavor

 chisaki -> all might
 twice -> hawks 
 (but they're all under survailence by HC?)]

Aizawa frowned. "Midoriya," he said, hating the fact that he couldn't even let th kid rest properly, but this was beyond his control so, "the lights aren't coming on," he said, and as the words came out of his mouth, Midoriya shot up.
The young man flinched, no doubt from proof of their passionate session, and his hand reached for his phone.
"Oh no," he gasped before his head fell to the pillow. "I-I'm really sorry, Aizawa-sensei. I-"
"Midoriya, just tell me what's going on."
His student sucked his cheeks in. He looked down at his hands, his face contorting into a pained expression, and Aizawa suppressed the urge to lean in and kiss those worries away. First, he needed to know what these worries were. 
"I... I didn't pay for the electriciy," Midoriya said, ashamed but honest. "I-I'm really sorry for the trouble. I... I was irresponsible and-"
"Midoriya, have you been paying your own bills?"
He thought about it. He had noticed that one of the shelves of All Might Merchanise was completely cleared out. He had been privately relieved that there was less All Might Memorabilla, but now, he felt sick. 
Hadn't enough been taken from Midoriya already? 
"Isn't that funny?" Midoriya asked, "We're training to be heroes. To become people that can protect other people and help police enforce justice." He covered his face, "But I can't even pay for electricity." 
"This... really shouldn't be your concern."
"Then, if I pretend that it's not and I pretend that it's not happening, will my electricity magically return?"
Aizawa's eyes widened, and Midoriya, understanding what he said, turned to him in shock.
"I... I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to say that aloud. You-You're right, there's nothing worth complaining about here. I should be working on finding a solution-"
"Midoriya," Aizawa's hands came to his shoulder. "I'm sorry," he said, because someone needed to tell him that he shouldn't need to sacrifice his joy to see tomorrow, and that it wasn't his fault that no one saw and no one noticed. "I should have noticed and reached out sooner."
Midoriya's head shot up and he shook his head. "No, it's okay. I-I need to be responsible anyways."
And Aizawa winced. When a child learned of responsibility, it meant that an adult had failed them. While it would be impossible to save everyone, and Aizawa was aware of that, he really wanted to do right by Midoriya. 
But he also knew Midoriya. Even if he didn't need to, he wanted to work for every last bit of aspect of his life. It was as inspiring as it was exhausting to watch. But this, Aizawa could do this.
"...There are some scholarship opportunities," he said, "that UA offers students who might need financial support. After all, if you're worried about the lights in your place, then you won't be worried about being a better hero." He tapped the wall, "When I tell you that you can rely on me, I mean that I can share information with you that you wouldn't have known about otherwise."
Which was bullshit, and he didn't care if he ended up paying for this "scholarship" out of pocket, he was going to do this for the hero that reminded him of the hero that he admired the most growing up. 
"R-Really?" Midoriya said.
Hopefully, and Aizawa was not a man of fate but he was about to start praying, Midoriya would finally believe him enough to share his troubles with him. 
"Yeah," Aizawa nodded. "We can't do everything by ourselves, Midoriya. That's true for adults, children, heroes and civilians." He gave him a crooked smile, and tried not to lose it when he saw the relieved slump of his shoulders.

-

Luckily, there were really scholarships for that kind of thing.
"...Midoriya-kun hasn't filed for a missing person report?" Nezu asked.
Aizawa thought about the closet, and shook his head. "He ... He doesn't think she's 'missing'."
Nezu frowned, "I see. Perhaps you could tell him that being 'missing' could help her re-integrate in society and recieve the help she needs, therapy and taxes and all, if she would like it." 
Aizawa nodded. Regardless of any personal feelings, it was a valid point. If Midoriya was missing the obvious bills, he had no doubt that their financial situation, credit scores and all, must be an uncontrollable maelstorm. The fact that Aizawa hadn't even thought of it had his stomach twisting. 
While he fucked Midoriya into the mattress with soft words and gentle promises, had Midoriya been concerned about the monsters in the closet, his grades, and where his next meal was coming from? And still, he could smile at his homeroom teacher and apologize for his shortcomings?
"I'll get on that," Aizawa said.
"I see. Is that also why you, Kan, Yamada, and Inui are engaging in inapropiate student-teacher conduct?"
Aizawa choked. He whipped around he gritted his teeth and tried to find the right thing to say. 
"I don't care what you do in your free time," he said honestly. "However, I do hope that you are supporting Midoriya, instead of being supported by him." The principal stared right at him, "Or else I will need to step in."
Although that icy touch of fear gripped his heart tightly, he still managed to feel grateful.
Because essentially, Nezu gave his word that he would keep an eye on Midoriya. He felt like Midoriya could use that kind of support.
"...Thank you," he said. 
Nezu smiled back and waved, "Please don't start a scandal. It would ruin Midoriya's career before it starts."
"Understood."
For now, they can say that the teachers are stepping in because Midoriya was missing his mother. When Midoriya's mother returned, he supposed he would have to do something else entirely. 
Starting with an apology. And then following up with a promise.

-

"Midoriya-kun, have you been struggling financially?"
Midoriya jolted. Eyes wide, he almost dropped the tea cup, and it clattered loudly back on the table.
"S-Sorry-"
Yagi's hands extended to grab Midoriya's hands, stopping him fom doing anything, and waited for a response.
"I'm not looking for an apology, Midoriya-shounen. I am asking because I am worried about you."
"S-Sorry for the worry, I'm fine. I am totally and absolutely fine. There was some trouble at home, but it's all working out now so I'm fine and I'll be okay, so you don't have to worry. I-I work harder so I don't disappoint you-"
Yagi's expression softened. 
"My boy, you are the furtherst thing from a disappointment."
Midoriya jolted, eyes wide. 

-

Midoriya woke up slowly, a yawn ripping through his throat, and when he sat up, realized there was an arm over his waist. Vaguely, he remembered sleeping alone. He looked to where Aizawa slept, half curled around him like a large cat, and his arm tightened around Midoriya's waist.
"It's Sunday," he murmured, eyebrows furrowed and clenching his eyes shut. "Sleep in." 
Midoriya hesitated. Was it really okay for him to rest? He needed to do his homework, and then he needed to head back into the dungeon. He didn't know what he was going to do about the bills, but most importantly, he needed to figure out the floor. The faster he did, the faster he could release the people he had from this awful mind-control curse he placed on them. 
He pulled his teacher's rm off of him, and pulled the cover up to his shoulder. 
"Izu...ku?" he mumbled. 
"Bathroom," Midoriya said quietly, because it wasn't a lie, just not the whole truth.
And Aizawa, reached a hand out to grab his head and yanked him down for a slow kiss. His tongue, languid and slow, met his and rolled around with Midoriya's tongue before he pulled back.
"Come right back," he said, before he flopped back onto the pillow and closed his eyes. 
Heart warm with a feeling that wasn't real, Midoriya smiled back. He got off the bed on shaky legs. Teetering to the bathroom, he got ready for the day.

-

"Why didn't you come back?"
If Midoriya was being honest, he would have said that he thought the feeling would have worn off by now. That he didn't want to over stay his welcome in Aizawa's life. But instead he smiled.
"I got hungry."
Aizawa nodded his head, and his eyes looked around to where Midoriya was doing his homework in the kitchen, the room furthest from the bedrooms. 
"And that's why your math textbook is out?"
Midoriya flushed and stammered out, "H-Hungry to learn!"
A hand came to his hair, gently ruffling it, and he felt warm all the way to his heart.
"It's okay," Aizawa said, "I'm not upset."
Midoriya nodded, hesitantly.
"Can I kiss you?" he asked.
The young man flinched, but clenched his eyes shut and closed his mouth. His teacher stared at him for a moment before he leaned in and kissed his forehead. Midoriya jolted, and peered up at him, wide-eyed.
"May I?" Aizawa asked quietly.
He nodded, and Aizawa's hand came to cup his cheek.
"It's okay to say no."
"I-I don't mind."
"That's not yes."
"Yes, please kiss me."
Lips were against his immediately. A hand reached behind him encompassing the entirety of his lower back with ease. A hot tongue licked against his lips, and Midoriya opened his mouth immediately, and gave a muffled moan when Aizawa's tongue touched his. He could feel the man's smile against his lips before he pulled back. 
Both of their breathing was labored. Midoriya kept his eyes close, focusing on his breathing, while Aizawa's heavy gaze looked over his face. He licked his lips before he finally pulled back.
"Get to studying, I'll make breakfast for you."
"S...Huh?" The words slowly processed in his head, and Midoriya shook his head. "Wait, Sensei, I should-"
The older man reached over and grabbed his hand. Midoriya gave this quiet "eep" sound, his face turning red, and the older man gave an exasperated smile, two-parts fond and one-part endeared, not that Midoriya understood what that expression of his meant.
"Could I make breakfast for you?" he asked again, feeling Midoriya's sweaty and clammy hands in his. The least he could do was make sure that the young man knew how it felt to be loved and beloved. His hand squeezed his, and patiently, he waited.
"Y-You don't have to..." and then his stomach growled loudly. His face darkened considerably and Aizawa pursed his lips. 
"Don't get your hopes up," Aizawa said, "I'm not much of a cook. What do you have in your fridge?"
Midoriya hesitated, and Aizawa felt an enroaching feeling of worry burrow in his heart."Midoriya, what... have you been eating?"
"Some... sometimes, Kan-sensei buys convienence store bentos for me."
"...And what have you been eating otherwise?"
There was a long slence and Aizawa turned around. He grabbed a cupboard when Midoriya's hands grabbed his shirt.
"Wait, Sensei, please don't be angry-"
Aizawa stared at the sight of within the cupboards. Reaching out, he grabbed it. In his head, he already knew. These were the cheapest brand of cat food that money could grab. He knew, because always raged in his head at the thought of anyone feeding their cats this garbage.
"S-sensei?"
How long? How long had Midoriya scraped around for his electricity and water, stressing about his empty apartment and the rent, living with literal monsters in his closet and still studying to be a hero? 
"Sensei, I can explain. It was a bargain discount! And it's not for me! I-"
The excuses came spilling from Midoriya's lips, but Aizawa understood what was going on. His student didn't own a cat, didn't find a stray in the streets, didn't have any form of cat hair coating any of his clothes or his home. 
"Midoriya," I'm not upset," he lied, and he turned around to face the young man. Clear as day, he could see that his student didn't believe him.
"I'm not upset at you," he said, so goddamn upset that he could feel himself getting nauseous. "Just... the situation. In general."
"I-I'm sorry."
"No," Aizawa's hands squeezed his shoulders, "It's not your fault. Maybe there were some bad decisions, but this... this situation isn't your fault."
And Aizawa's eyes narrowed when Midoriya's eyes started to water. It couldn't be...
"Midoriya," he repeated, and very sternly said, "I know you're doing your best given what you have. You have done well. Good job holding out. From now on, I won't let you be by yourself."

-

"Twice," Midoriya smiled and Twice froze in the doorway, "Welcome back! The lady next door said she made too much for dinner so we're eating fried rice. Go wash your hands and let's eat together."
The man stared at him for a long, long moment before the tears came streaming down his face.
Midoriya jolted and rushed forward, "Twice-"
The man covered his face and turned away, and Midoriya stopped an arm's distance away from him.
"I'm fine," he said, voice croaking. He took a shaky step forward and wrapped his arms around the young man. He sniffled loudly. "I'm fine now."
Midoriya felt his shoulder soak, and wrapped his arms around the older man. Quietly, he wondered if there was a way to save him.
"Hard day at work?" he hoped not, because he felt like Twice deserved a little bit of slack. Just enough to let him rest and reorient himself.
"I'm okay," Twice said, arms tight around his waist as he trembled with every breath. 

-

"In Midoriya's future," Chisaki said, leaning back against the wall as he stared blankly forward, "It would appear that I am not there."
He looked at his hands.
"Oyaji once told me to be careful of people who inspire us. If we trail too close to the sun, we will burn."
His hands hung limply at his side. 
"I never thought that protecting someone could feel so heavy."



### villain academia 

-

"Yes," and Iida's bright demeanor finally dimmed because, "So I have been held back for three years."
Midoriya's eyebrows hit his hairline.
"Th... three years?" he asked. 
Iida pinched the brdige of his nose and sniffled. "Excuse me," he said, voice trembling.
And regardless of how Midoriya felt, seeing Iida like this made his heart ache. He grabbed the man's hand, and gave a small smile.
"It's okay, Iida-kun," he said. "Let's move up another year together."
Iida turned to him, eyes bright and shining. Unshed tears looked up at him, and Midoriya gave him a helpless smile. For a student at Villain Academia, he looked so hopeful.

-

"According to this," Midoriya said, reading from his note summary, "It says that merit points are given based on the number of rules that are broken."
The problem was, he supposed, that they had to be caught breaking the rules. In that case, the easiest way to advance would be to not show up to class. Assuming that their homeroom teacher took attendence, they would be noticed for breaking the rules.
Demerit points would be granted to students who did exceptionally well. He supposed rule-breakers like Iida-kun. He looked at his friend, who nodded seriously as he solved problems from his textbook.
"Iida-kun," he said, "could I check your ID?"
By scanning a student's ID in their school app, it was easy to check where a student standing was.
"Yes, of course," Iida handed it over, as trusting as always. He gave a shy smile. "I... I'm afraid that my record isn't very impressive." 
Midoriya smiled back, because Iida-kun was a good person. The person that came so gallantly to help him pick up his books was someone with compassion and a gentle heart made up of hard-work and empathy. 
"We need to first figure out where we start," Midoriya reminded him, a smile on his face, "But if you don't feel comfortable with it, that's okay, too." He nodded his head, "I want to earn that trust."
Iida stared at him before his gaze dropped to his lap. He sniffled loudly, again. Lifting his glasses with one hand, he brought the other hand up and squeezed the bridge of his nose. He took a deep breath, and then turned back to Midoriya with a watery smile.
"Midoriya-kun, I'm so lucky to have met you."
Thinking of it like this, it was easy for Midoriya to sabotage this man. 
"If you trust me, you're also trusting me not to sabotage you," he said, unable to help himself.
"But Midoriya-kun, doesn't it also mean that I don't mind if you betray me?"
Midoriya felt his heart squeeze. 
Iida passed him his Student ID, a heartening smile on his face. 
Midoriya stared at it for a moment before he pulled his wallet out and pulled his ID out too. He handed it over to Iida.
"Me too, Iida-kun," he said. "I don't mind being betrayed by you."
The light that entered Iida's eyes was brighter than anything he could have imagined. It made Midoriya straighten and smile back, feeling as though he could take on the world. 
With their ID's exchanged, Midoriya scanned Iida's ID and blanched at the number of demerits he had. Come to think of it, it was obvious that, since Iida had attented this school for so long, he would have a large number of demerits. But still... 
There were so many zeroes behind that nine. He pursed his lips and looked back at Iida and his sheepish expression. 
This... might be more serious than he thought. 

-

"I..." Midoriya hestiated. "Wait, he's been in your class for three years?"
Aizawa sucked on the cigarette, dark bags under his eyes as he scowled. 
"Yep."
Midoriya did the math.
"You've been teaching since you were ten?"
Aizawa's grin, full of malicious energy and biting confidence, stretched into something dangerous.
