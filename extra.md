### returning a gift 

"Are you stupid? Of course this isn't illegal," aniki said, his voice barely louder than the crackle of fire, "since we didn't get caught."
Midoriya felt cold. 

--- 


"They don't like me because I'm young," he explained. "So everything that they say is all 'you don't have any sense of respect or dignity,' and well, they're not wrong." Midoriya shrugged, "But dignity and respect won't fill my stomach."
He gave a smile, sharp like a knife, as he spun a pen in his hand.
"When I have money, that is, when I can afford to, I sure that I'll have enough dinigty and respect to crush all the bottom fodders who have none of their own."
He pushed the bag into the water. 
"Until then, Kawasaki-san. I won't ever forget what you taught me."
In the dark of the night, the only light visible was when Midoriya lit his cigarette. A small bead of red light framed by the shadows came when he inhaled. A small light, but the only one anyone would lit for this man.

---

Leaning against the wall, Midoriya placed his hand onver his eyes in shock. He could hardly believe it. He wasn't crying. All this time, and he wasn't crying. Was he finally out? Was emptahy something that could be wrung out of him like people squeeze water out of an old rag?
His mother's death was modest but beautiful. A photo of when she was vibrant was framed, decorated by flowers of every color, as though the palette from the petals would replace the fact that only Izuku was here.
His heart was empty. When he died, no one would remember him, because she just died. Cold and hollow. He wondered where Inko went wrong, that such a warm person would give birth to an empty and cold shell of a human being like himself. 
Her son, the only person that attended her quiet service, did not cry at her funeral.
Her son, the only person who actually loved her as much as he was loved, found comfort in her death. Since she was dead, those damn hospital bills would finally end. He would inherit all that insurance money and everything that was left to her by her parents, and he would finally be out of this awful debt. He could run away from the yakuza, maybe from the country, and figure out what a quirkless person could do someplace that he defame. 
In that moment, he understood what All Might meant by the fact that he could never become a hero.

---

"No, no," Midoriya shook his head, a laugh playing on his lips, "I'd make a terrible villain."
"Oh?" Giran grinned back, because it was polite where he was from.
"Yes, villains are people who don't change. They're dedicated to their ideal and their lifestyle, so much that they wouldn't mind making an enemy out of the rest of the world if it meant that they don't have to change."
"And you? You don't want that?"
"It would be nice, but I'm neither strong or dedicated," the young man said, a sheepish smile on his face. "I'm barely passing high school chemistry and paying my bills," he said, and his weaknesses and worthlessness seemed to only be accented by the bruise on his face. "I wouldn't make the cut to be a villain, I'm trying too hard to survive as a law-abiding citizen."
More than any weapon and any quirk, however, Midoriya scared Giran. When everyone was clawing for the top and demanding every scrap of attention they could get a hold of, people like Midoriya who willingly passed it up terrified him. Because Midoriya was smart. 
Midoriya, who killed people and tortured people, could smile like he was a civilian who had never witnessed violence before. 
"And that includes working in a yakuza?"
"Being in debt is a totally normal thing for law-abiding citizens. I would know."

---

But Toga wouldn't know. There was so many people in the world that she thought was beautiful. People that dazzled in font of her before their life was existinguished. People were truly like stars, limitless in numbers, bright and dazzling, and the rest of the world would only learn that they were gone long after their death. 
It was sad, in a really beautiful and poetic way. As long as they could be framed and stained by that beautiful shade of red, Toga thought that she could fall in love with anyone.
It was okay, because she knew that she wasn't right in the head. Or right enough for society. And she didn't really care about that anymore. She didn't want to be someone she wasn't anymore. Even if the whole world lied to her all the time, she didn't have to. Because it was'nt like she fit into that perfect frame of a Himiko's Daughter anyways.

But maybe she was wrong.

---

"Do you remember?" Dabi asked, "When you asked me what I liked in the world?"
Midoriya furrowed his brows, not because he didn't remember, but because he confused why Dabi was bringing it up as they ate instant ramen in the office at three am. Or maybe he was shocked that Dabi had remembered at all.
"Yes?" he said. "Uh... I mean, yes, I remember but... Why are you bringing that up?"
"I have an answer now," Dabi said.
"Dabi that was years ago," Midoriya said, eyes wide. "You were holding onto that this whole time?" 
The taller man snorted, but the humor that shined in his eyes was breathtaking. He tilted his head, a smile starting to stretch his lips.
"Yeah."
He slurped his noodles unnessesarily loudly.
"Wait, are you going to answer the question?" Midoriya asked, eyes wide. 
"I did," Dabi replied back.
"When?"
Midoriya narrowed his eys, their conversation no doubt already repeating in his head. Dabi's grin grew two sizes too big, feeling his face twitch in the effort to keep it up. If he was a little younger and a bit more bright-eyed, he might have been more explict about it. But, there was joy in seeing the realization sink in his eyes and his face explode out into that shade of red. Dabi chuckled, feeling lighter and brighter than anything else. 
The last of his chuckles felt like the last sparks at the bottom of a fire, and Dabi didn't realied being extinguished was such an uplifting feeling.
"That's cheap," Midoriya huffed. His eyes trailed from Dabi to his ramen and then back again. Dabi's insufferable gin could still be seen from the corners of his face. 
And Dabi, satisfied that Midoriya would be thinking soley of him for some time, thought that their instant meal was even better than usual. 

---

"And two eggs for him," Twice said, pointing to Dabi.
Dabi watched the ramenstand owner scowl, but do just that. How come all the standowners that they go to are all old assholes? As curious as it was, he supposed that Midoriya just attrached that kind of energy. More importantly, he tilted his head to stare at the blond he came in with.
"Two eggs?"
"Yeah, that's what you always get, right?" Twice replied back, "I thought it was your favorite."
Dabi hesitated, because it didn't use to be.
"And you know what I want on my okonamiyaki, right?"
Double servings of unagi with a side of peppers to the side, he didn't say aloud.
"How would I know? I don't care."
But they've been together for too long after all, because Twice pointed at laughed at Dabi.
"And that's the expression you make when you lie about something that'll make you look considerate. You big kitten! // Shitty dog!"
Dabi scowled harder, ready to kick some sense into Twice, but remembering where they were, restrained himself. 
He'll trash Twice later.

---

"You still like hard-boiled eggs in your ramen?" Natsuo asked, short of amazed as his eyes stared at the ramen.
"Don't think too hard about it," Dabi said. After a second, he sighed, "And for a while, I really hated it."
Natsuo peered up at him, the question clear in his eyes. Where did he go? Why didn't he come home? Why didn't he take Natsuo with him?
Dabi sighed, reaching into his ramen to pass him one of his two eggs into Natsuo's bowl, the same way they used to when they were convinced that they could be worthy of someone's love if they just tried hard enough.
"I just don't hate it as much as I hate other things. Don't think too hard about it."
Natsuo nodded slowly, like he was slowly processing the words. The taller man looked down at his ramen. Supposedly, they were older and therefore had all the answers they didn't have as children. Supposedly, they should have seen and experienced enough of the world to know how to act with each other, and have everything feel better with a snap of their fingers.
Maybe they haven't grown up. All that they've seen and experienced in the world only accumulated in that they should have continued to pretend that Touya was dead and they were strangers with startling similarities.
"I knew it was Dabi and Natsuo-san!" a bright voice came, and as always, Natsuo watched a smile stretch across Dabi's face as he straightened in his seat.
"Ah boss," Dabi called back, just as lazy, "You know, if you stalk your employees to their lunch break, we gotta call HR on you for harrasment." He scooted over for the young man to take his jacket off and drape it over the booth seat as he climbed in. 
"Don't be silly Dabi, I pay HR too much to be taken in for such a small scheme," the young man replied back with a sweet smile. 
Dabi rolled his eyes, and Midoriya motioned for one of the petrified waitstaff to take his order.
"Try their Godzilla," he said, "It's pretty good. Get extra chashu."
"Are you paying for it?" Mioriya sniped back. The taller man took this chance to slurp on some noodles. "Yeah, that's what I thought." Still, when he turned to the pale waitstaff member, he ordered a Godzilla with extra chashu."
"And another egg," Dabi added to the order.
With a long-suffered sigh from Midoriya, another egg was added to the order.
"It can't be healthy to eat as much eggs as you do."
"If we cared about being healthy, we wouldn't be eating ramen."
Midoriya rolled his eyes, but didn't say anything more.
And Natsuo wondered when they would remember that he was here. He thought it was incredibly telling, that he didn't even realize how tense Dabi was until Midoriya. He wondered if, he was born to a family made of love and not ambition, he would understand what it was like. 

### sat

Fuck Spring. Fuck Fall. Just fuck everyday, but those two seasons in particular. 
These thoughts repeated in Midoriya's head as he pulled his bloodied elbow from Twice's face. Stepping back as the blond dropped to the ground, he grimaced when he saw that Twice's pants were still tented. 
"You with me now?"
"...Mate..." Twice whispered quietly. It would be pathetic, if Midoriya could muster the strength to feel pity for the blond. For good measure, he kicked him in the side. 
Normally, he would take the blond to Chisaki personally, but during these times, it was better to keep some distance. He didn't know if it was better that everyone's rut was hitting the same time, or if it would be better to time them out so he could just throw them into a room, a week or two at a time. 
Blackwhip formed at his arm as he heard the footsteps approach. The smell was putrid. Midoriya needed to get to his helmet fast.
The door slid open, and there was Nighteye.
"Izuku, rut season..." the older man trailed off, no doubt taking in the sight of Twice groaning on the ground. 
"Take him to Chisaki," Midoriya said. He hated it, but they smelled good. His mouth felt unnaturally parched, and he just knew that his features were probably flushed. Covering his mouth and nose with his hand, as though that would help at all, he took a step back.
"Understood," Nighteye said. Midoriya had a lot of respect for the man. If he was even half as affected as Twice was, he had remarkable self-control and restraint over himself. It was impressive. "Be safe."
"Nothing new," Midoriya replied back, opening a window. It would be the wrong room, because the incoming breeze carried his scent straight to Nighteye. He watched as the man's eyes turned to slits and the fangs start to elongate. His eyes darted from Midoriya to Twice and then back, but by then, Midoriya was already out the window. He had no desire to make them suffer for no reason. 

-

Getting to his helmet was easy. At the very least, the dogs weren't too bothered by this whole mess. They had their own shit to worry about, and no one was going to bother them. He grabbed his helmet, clipped it on, and grabbed his dented bat and his knives.
Time for patrol. It wasn't like monsters let them be just because they were a little more horny than before.
"Izuku, are you on your way out?"
Midoriya waved as Hawks dropped down next to him. Either Hawks had impeccable control over his phermones, or Midoriya's helmet was really clamping down on the scent. And then, Hawks stepped back by a foot. 
Heat weeks were awful. Midoriya thought, but they were getting much better at dealing with them. Well, if they didn't want to deal with additional injuries, they would have to. Midoriya didn't shy from brutal reactions. If people couldn't handle it, then they shouldn't have come for him.

-

"This is insane!" one of the betas, because it was always a beta, an older gentleman that took command over the other quiet and very opinionated betas on base. "You broke his all of his fingers!" he shouted.
Midoriya, who was getting his arm stitched up by something else 

-

And of course, his favorite part of rutting statements. The words of people who knew better than him. 
"Well, we wouldn't need to do any of these things if we didn't have an unbonded omega strutting about on base."
"Izuku, you should consider making life easier for everyone and accept a bond."
Which was bullshit, unless they had an omega for ever alpha here. Unless they meant that he would service all these alphas. Actually, they could mean that, given the nature of pushover betas who ganged up on anyone who rocked their shitty boat. Sacrifice one omega to all the rutting alphas, just get all the rut out of those alphas, and the whole rutting season would be over in a week or two. Obviously, the omega would be in less-than-ideal shape, but that wasn't their problem. They wanted to live easy, peaceful and without needing to tread on ice around every growling, territorial, snaring alpha. It was fair. If Midoriya was in their position, he would probably do the same thing.
He's considered it. Since they had a few healing-quirks and Overhaul, it wasn't like it would be impossible. And no doubt, it was something that would happen to him eventually. Most likely, it would be how he died, fucked out or while during birth. Midoriya had come to terms with that, and it didn't effect him. 
However, the alphas here were kind-hearted. If he showed even the slightest bit of favorable interest, they would hold onto it. They would clutch onto that possibility, and Midoriya, who had no plans to live past the next ten years, didn't want to condemn them to something so pitiful. 
"Are you volunteering?" Midoriya replied back, a cruel smile on his lips. 
"Well, I'm not an omega, so it wouldn't work."
"Oh, you've already tried it?"
The beta's face flushed red, the implications not going unmissed, but Midoriya thought that was interesting. It was something worth getting so flustered over, but they could recommend someone else to do it just as easily. This was an old arguement, one that they always brought and Midoriya always replied back in kind. You would think that they would learn by now. 
You would think that he would learn by now.
"Everyone knows that only omegas could do something like that," the beta blurted out. "And since you're the leader here, you should be taking care of it."
"I'll take care of it the same way I always have. Not sure how you missed that, since you've lived here a while, but I'm sure we can teach an old dog a few new tricks."
Gnashing teeth, looks of contempt, the whispering behind his back, all of it were things he was used to. All of it were things that he expected. None of it meant anything to him. Back when he was younger and wasn't killing to see another day, he might have bent under their words and destroyed himself in an effort to make the area he was living in easier for everyone else. 
Not now. But back then.
He gave a wave as he left, because the world would keep turning regardless of how many times they fought here and now.

---

Shattered mirrors framed the ground, decorating the ground in shards like snowfall. He raised his arm to wipe at his forehead, but stopped when he realized how much blood was dripping down his arm. The ugly gash on his forearm didn't reveal any bone, so he supposed that they weren't that deep at all. His other arm was still trembling from excertion.
Figures that the room he crashed into was housing all these mirrors. At the very least, nothing escaped and the piles of limbs soaking in ponds of blood were proof that they would never get up again. All that was left was burning them all. 
Barefoot on broken shards, Midoriya took a deep breath to calm his heartbeat. Come to think of it, he totally lost his commlink. It shattered in his ear from a stray shot and he all but tore out the rest. He could already imagine what kind of lecture he would get from this again.
When he turned to leave, the world spun around him. Maybe he lost more blood than he thought. He took a deep breath, trying to stabilize himself.
The crunching of glass sounded, and his hand flexed into a fist. There was no way that something lived through him tearing their body apart, so a new enemy must have arrived.
"Izuku-"
The halting tone, laced with conern and near panic, made something coil inside of Midoriya. Was someone hurt? Did they lose someone? While he was killing everything in here, was there a bigger fight somewhere else? Irritation filled his bloodstream before concern could. Why couldn't all the damn monsters just congregated into one place so that he could just get rid of them all in one go. It would certainly make his life easier than having to run around to chase them down.
"-hear me?"
His head was still swimming, if he could see four blurry Mirios instead of one, but his arm stopped shaking now, so it didn't really matter. He could fight. He could still fight.
"No, no, no fights," Mirio said, and Midoriya squinted at him. Why was it so hard to hear him?
Mirio's face (faces?) twisted into something packed with remorse. Why? Midoriya wanted to demand. Did he lose something? Did he break something? Was he hurt? Was someone else hurt?
The questions clogged his throat, packing on too fast for him to get any of them out in a coherent way.
Mirio reached for him, eye wide and Midoriya took a step back to avoid his touch. At once, he felt threatened. His focus sharpened incredibly. 
The blond stared at him, his hand dropping to his side. 
"...We should get you looked at. It looks... It looks really bad."
"...I haven't checked the third floor," Midoriya said.
Mirio's jaw tightened and Midoriya narrowed his eyes. 
"Best Jeanist and Miruko already headed up," he explained, "We can take a moment before joining up with them."
But why? Why was Mirio so desperate to get him away from here? Was there something here? Or better yet, was there something at the supposed 'breakplace' that he was advocating for? Midoriya couldn't get an answer.
However, he did know that he hadn't gone through the upper floors. 
"I haven't checked the third floor," he repeated himself, firmer this time. A part of him was grateful for Mirio, he felt like he returned to the edge of the rooftop. The fear of tipping over will keep his wits about him. He walked by the blond, and out the door with only his thoughts.

-

Midoriya leaned his back against the wall and took a deep breath. In through his nose, exhale out through his mouth. He tried to move his fingers. Looking down at his hands, he tried again. 


### apoc

"I... I really wanted to be a hero," Tokoyami admitted. "but I left my mom and dad to fend off the neighborhood association by themselves, and selfishly, I survived. I just ran and ran."
Jesus fuck, Deku didn't say aloud. Why did people just unload like this on him? He didn't know what to say, where to even start. Should he tell him the things that he heard some of the heroes say around the base? That it was okay and that it was good that at least Tokoyami made it out?
Then, the first thing that Deku would say to Tokoyami would be his insincere words. He bit his tongue. He didn't want that. Then, he should first introduce himself, and then he could give his insincere advise. 
The more he thought about it, the less it made sense. As a result, he didn't say anything at all.
"I don't know what to do. What I want to do. What I should do. I do'nt have any answers, or even how to even start getting one," Tokoyami continued. "I don't get it. What can I even do?"
Deku stared at him for another moment, but those were all questions he struggled with to. Eventually, he got an answer, but it wasn't something that he would ever recomend someone else to do. Besides, what worked for him might not work for Tokoyami. Still, what could he say? "You'll figure it out?" "Don't worry about it?" "It'll come with time?" Aside from the fact that they didn't answer the question at all, it was insulting and straight up condesending. At that point, wouldn't it be better to say nothing at all?
By the time Deku came to the conclusion that there was nothing he could say to Tokoyami, several minutes had gone by, and he had left the young man far behind. He almost felt bad, but at the same time, frowned. Why ask if he wasn't going to wait for an answer? It almost made Deku feel stupid for trying so hard to find an answer, even if he didn't have one. 
Whatever.
Bat in his hand, there was only thing he was good for anyways.

-

At the very least, when the world ended, it became quiet. Once the destruction calmed down (and it has calmed down entirely in these last six months), it was like the whole world was a graveyard. And Tokoyami could finally just fucking think.
Think, but he couldn't get an answer. Think, but budding questions had yet to fruit any answers. Frustrated and annoyed, he took a deep breath. Helmet continued to walk away and Tokoyami felt something boil inside of him. It wasn't fair, because it felt like Helmet had it all figured out. From saving strangers and housing them, literally cleaning the streets and base, keeping stock of suppies and everything, it felt like there was rhyme and reason in Helmet and all that he did. Looking at him, Tokoyami felt stupid for stressing so hard about the world ending when this man operatred like this was all he ever knew. 
But, unlike the places he's been, and the people he was with, no one said that he had to work and no one said he should go run off and play. Where he recieved no instruction, he felt a suffocating amount of freedom. Like the eternal opening of the entire world and all the possibilities would smoother him out of existance because he didn't have any drive or direction.
And Tokoyami had a hard time getting out of bed and getting back out again.
Right when his feet got to the door, that sinking fear returned. How could anyone choose to go back out? There were literal monsters, big like fear and too much like they crawled out of a nightmare, but there was a chorus of dogs barking. The talltale sound of people, laughing and sounding but Tokoyami couldn't make out any words. Just the sound. The hum of life, behind his door where he couldn't see. 
Today, they returned from going outside.
Okay, he thought, tomorrow. Tomorrow he'll open the door.
Tomorrow came, and he smelled blood. Worried yelling calling for first-aid and emergency help. Tokoyami could not help, and felt that rush because you see? Look? It was meaningless! There was no point in going out and fighting. There was no point because there were monsters.
Without taking a step outside, he closed the door again.
It would be several days later. Several days where the hum of sound sounded outside of his door and enrouached in the apartment that he was occupying. Several days where he wanted to scream and cry because why didn't they just understand that there was nothing worth fighting for and that there was no point anyways-
A knock came on the door. His heart stopped. Frozen on the nest of blankets he made in the otherwise empty living room, Tokoyami stared at the door in shock. What could he do? What could he say? He glanced briefly outside, where moonlight trickled into the room from the filmsy blinds, and then back.
What?
Curiosity brought him to the door. What could it be? Who would knock so politely in the middle of the night like that? When he peered through the looking-hole, he didn't see anything. Even though there was nothing there, that didn't mean shit when he didn't know what anyone's quirk was. For all he knew, they were just waiting for the right timing and were going to pry him out of the apartment. For all he knew...
He opened the door.
He looked down, and found a basket of apples sitting in front of his door. His mouth immediately watered, it had been a very long time since he saw anything resembling fruits-
"Oh! Apples, I love apples!"
The voice was familiar but it was loud. Even though it was a normal tone, it was loud enough that Tokoyami's heart leapt out of his chest. He whipped around, and from a long period of habit had the words pouring out of his unused throat.
"Dark Shadow, be silent as night!"
And he stared.
He hadn't seen Dark Shadow in a literal year. The summer air, even at night, was warm.
"Aw, Fumikage don't be like that. But you should hurry up and bring those apples in befor they rot!"
Tears began to outpour from Tokoyami's eyes like a leaky facuet.
Tokoyami Fumikage learned that he did not lose everything. The next step was easy like breathing. Simple in its clarity. 

---

Deku rubbed his face with the inside of his arm. He sniffled loudly, and took a deep breath. It felt as though his organs were made of lead, and it was determined to come crashing down on the ground. But he couldn't do that. He needed to keep moving forward. 
Like that, Aizawa came running into the hallway. The man's steps came to a sharp stop.
"Deku," he called out, his eyes widening as he took in Deku's features.
"Shota," Deku's voice was a little more coherent than a strangled croak. He tried to clear his throat, but it didn't help much. "It's clear here. We should move up." 
The older man stared for a moment longer before he made his way to Deku. In less than a second, he had an arm around Deku's shoulders and pulled him close to his chest. The young man gasped, flustered and shocked, but when his hands came up to grab Aizawa's arms because he was caked in blood and it was gross why would anyone want to hold him now-
"Welcome back," he said, voice right next to his ear. "I'm glad you're alive."
And the part of Deku that had been alone, alone because he couldn't help someone, alone because he killed everyone else, alone and alone and alone, broke inside of his heart. The feeling or someone waiting him was painful. His arms hung uselessly by his side, and he could feel the warmth from Aizawa seeping into his empty self. 
He pulled back, and Deku, the fool he was, stepped forward to follow him. When he realized what he did, he jerked backwards.
"...Sorry," he said, because someone should apologize for this entire thing going belly up. He tried to clear his throat again, and his eyes stung as they watered. "I-"
"You don't have to apologize for returning alive," Aizawa said, his voice tight. "Not to me. I am and I always will be grateful and relieved to see you alive."
Body breaking into shudders, Deku shook his head. Aizawa neeed to stop. He needed to stop before Deku believed him. He needed to stop before Deku believed and started to think that it was actually okay to live. 
"Deku-"
"We need to go," Deku blurted out, even as his back hit the wall. His hands clenched and unclenched from fists and opened and then back into fists. "So, don't... Don't say that."
Aizawa's expression tightened, teetering onto something that looked painful, as he regarded Deku. In these moments, Deku regretted ever letting it be known who he was. This man was much happier back when he didn't know who was under the helmet. 

-

"Welcome back, everyone!"
Deku flinched. It would have been funier, but Aizawa had seen him impaled by claws before and he didn't flinch then. He flinched when people welcomed him back. Before, with the helmet on, they always thought that he was sensitive to loud sounds. Now, he was closer to a harsher truth. 
Still, the young man raised his hand, recognizing that he heard them, or whateve,r and that wasn't something that they ever got from Helmet.
Far away, in the privacy of his own mind, Aizawa wondered if Deku always assumed that someone else was being welcomed.

[in which midoriya is the second protagonist]
