"Yep, it's just terrible when people don't listen, isn't it?"
Enji's jaw clicked shut, and his sharp gaze narrowed at the person who spoke to him.
Hawks gave an exaggerated shrug.
"It's like wearing a pair of new jeans," Hakamata agreed. 
The Winged Hero's smile fell. "No, it's really not," he tried but was immediately ignored.
"Of course not, it's like biting into burnt mochi."
"Now you guys are doing this on purpose," Hawks said, turning back to Enji. However, the smile was starting to return to his face.
Peering around the corner and watching the trio almost laugh, Midoriya slinked back to give them another second of happiness. He leaned his head back, closing his eyes and just listened. When he went to join them, they would stop laughing, they would go and fight, and so Midoriya stood against the wal, counting backwards from ten.
Ten seconds. He could give them ten more seconds of joy that they wouldn't have ever felt otherwise.

-

"Puh-please!"
Hawks felt his heart squeeze.
"Please, let me go! Please, don't kill me!"
The man struggled uselessly against Hakamata's strings, grunting and groaning all the while. Sweat dripped down his balding head as he gave them a weak smile.
"I-I didn't know that there were still heroes, still hope out here! We were just doing our best to survive!"
Hawks narrowed his eyes, because he knew. He used to be apart of a group like this, that fell apart the same way. People got greedy, someone got the idea that they have more of something than another, resources was scarce, and people wanted power. Some mixture of the list bubbled up into something truly ugly, and suffocating, people start to fight. For while, Hawks had started to believe that this was only way that people could live.
Not anymore, but.
"A-And you're a hero, please! Why didn't you come and save us earlier?! Where were you?" he demanded. 
Well, the thing about guys like this was that they weren't looking to change. They were looking for ways to survive without changing how they lived. Meaning, whatever happened here that left this man surrounded by naked, dead woman, was going to be dragged back to their base.
Back to Midoriya. 
For Hawks, that was unacceptable. Determined to relieve Midoriya of anymore baggage, he made his choice.
"Wait-wait let's talk about this! Please! Wait! C'mon, say something! You're a Hero, aren't you? You-"
Something smacked him in the back and Hawks jerked. Safely evacuating to the side, he stared in shock as a panting Midoriya stood at the doorframe. Green eyes looked around the room, and Hawks could already imagine the level of shit he was going to get from Stain when the survivor's eyes landed on Midoriya.
"An... omega?"
Midoriya stood up, and Hawks wondered what he was doing that he had a fresh cut on his arm.
"Izu-"
Ignored, Midoriya stepped forward and kneeled down in front of the survivor. Lifting a card towards the man, green eyes focused on the man.
"What do you know about this?" he asked.
The survivor looked from Hawks to Hakamata, and without even twitching, Hakamata tightened the string. The man gave this choking cough.
"I-I'll talk!" he said, "I'll talk so please! Please let me go."
"Cooperate and we'll let you go alive with supplies," Midoriya said. "What do you know about this?"
The man hesitated, "It's... it's a pharma down the steet," he said. "Uh... one of the guys here was a part of it, but he went out for supplies and never came back. Damn bastard probably got what he deserved after abandoning us like that."
"Where?" Midoriya asked.
"D-Down the street! I don't know?" he said. "Maybe somewhere downtown? It gotta be someplace huge though, since they said that it had an underground parking lot."
Midoriya nodded. He stood up and motioned for Hakamata.
"Let him go."
"Wait, you-you promised supplies."
Midoriya nodded. "My bag's outside," he said.
"I'll get it for you," Hawks said, wings open. In less than three seconds, he was back with his bag. 
Midoriya popped it open, grabbed the bag of ID's he was collecting and his planner, before throwing it at floor in front of the survivor. His entire bag, with a decent amount of food, first-aid, and extra knives was given to the stranger. At the same time, Hakamata released him from the strings.
"Wait!" the survivor said, clutching the bag against his chest. "That... That's it?" 
Midoriya didn't answer him and instead turned around to leave.
"Wait, you damn omega! You think this is it? You might be able to survive off of this, but an alpha like me needs more! This won't even feed me for a day! I-"
Hawks stood in front of Midoriya, the same time Hakamata's strings came for his throat.
"A-ah... is he yours?" the man asked, suddenly meek now that the two were exuding their pressence. "M-My apologies. I guess the h-hunger really got to me. But you know, if he's yours, you should do a better job managing him. If-if you would like, I could do that for you." And it was like running his mouth had given him an idea, because he suddenly brightened. "Yes! I could! Take me with you! I-I'll defineately pull my weight and I'll be happy to take him off your hands-"
Midoriya was already out of the room and down the hallway, no doubt already planning on hitting the pharmacy. 
"-You said your piece," Hakamata said, a thousand times calmer than Hawks felt. "And we kept our word."
"Wait, please don't leave me alone-"
The former heroes left, because every second they wasted here was a second that they could have spent supporting Midoriya, and that was their priority.

-

"Where's your bag?" Shigaraki asked, eyeing Midoriya and the fact that he was carrying an open ziploc of ID cards.
"I lost it," Midoriya replied back. 
The older man stared at him and squinted, "Don't lie to me," he snapped back. "Just say that you don't want to tell me."
The young man didn't respond. 
"Or that," Shigaraki sighed, "I just figured that we were close enough this wasn't something you needed to lie about."
There was no answer this time either, and there was no way to check if Midoriya heard him. Shigaraki wondered why it was so damn hard to make conversation. 

-

It felt obvious why someone would come to a pharmacy. Even before mosnters became an occurance, the vast majority of people went to a pharmacy for one reason, after all. A lot of that reasoning was the same. Between Chisaki, Yaoyozuro, and their healing staff, there was rarely a need for them to need various medical equipment. 
But it never hurt to air on the side of caution. 
All things considered, the pharmacy was standing. Which was good, if a little suspicious. Their suspicions were quickly confirmed when a several monsters, large hulking masses of flesh with disproportiotely larger arms dragging behind them, were sighted. 
It would appear that it was mainly unbothered because it was already occupied. However, it also meant that there would be a good chance that there would be a plethora of things they could use without damaging the things that were inside.
Hawks didn't realize that was the case until he found Midoriya in a hallway by himself. At first, he was worried that the young man was injured and quietly dealing with it. When suddenly, his hand came and slammed into the side of the wall. Alarmed, Hawks came closer.
"Izuku?" he called out, "Is something wrong?"
The young man spun around, and Hawks wondered how out of it he was that he didn't even notice him approaching.
The young man stared at him for a moment and then sighed.
"I thought that there would be some information but..."
He took a step to the side, and Hawks took that as an invitation to step closer. Golden eyes peered in to see what he was talking about, and saw a barren room. Desks and chairs were overturned, cabinents were open and empty, and he took a step back to stare at the room plaqurd. [Data Storage]
"...Well someone picked it clean."
While they were cheering about the fact that they found medicine and first aid and the likes, what did Midoriya fail to find.
"...What were you looking for?"
"Hope," Midoriya said quietly. 
Hawks' heart throbbed. He turned to where the young man leaned against the wall, eyes staring forward blankly. The young man covered his eyes and took a deep breath.
"I thought that... if anyone had figured something out about what was going on, it'd be in a place where there's some research going on." He sighed back, "Well, whatever. If not here, then the next place. Let's finish clearing this out and head back. There's going to be a lot to do in the next few days."
While they all sat back and accepted that this was life now, Hawks had never considered the notion that of all of them, Midoriya was the one looking for a way back the most. As heavy as it weight inside of him, it also made him hopeful. Unlike before, after all, Midoriya told him why he wanted to come here so badly.
It could because Midoriya was too tired to put his guard up. It could also be because he trusted Hawks enough to let it go. 

-

Obviously, he dreamed about moments like this. 
Midoriya, underneath him, the warmth of his body against his. Things of that nature.
Usually, in his dreams, they aren't

### apoc

[1:57 PM]
Deku tore his helmet off. Spitting out a mouthfull of blood, his eyes carefully searched the area around him. Tilting his head to the side, he thought carefully. 
The most important thing to him were the people that greeted him so warmly. Without a doubt, the most precious thing to him were the people that inspired him everyday. He wanted to do them well, since it felt like a type of repentence for all that he's done. On occasion, it even made him even feel like it was okay to be alive.
Then, what did he need to do to keep them safe? 
He needed to kill all these monsters.
Then, what did he need to do to preserve their smiles?
He needed to make sure he killed all of these small monsters before they could scar the people here.
Iida, who treasured his brother, and Hakamata, who refereed their sports matchups fondly, and Stain, who brought back trinkets for some of their younger members, haunted him. The list went on and on. 
A desk slid and Deku wasted no time sending blackwhip out to crush the desk.
As graphically and as brutally, he needed to end this so that no one knew what he fought. He needed this to end now.
The quirk that wasn't his pulsed in his bloodstream, as though rejecting being used for such a dirty task. Which was fine. This was a job for Deku, after all.
He brought the bat up and swung at the head of a monster that came up to his thigh. No bigger than Kouta, he imagined that it must have had a bright future before. He grabbed the pin on its (her) chest. Satsuki Kayo-chan, a first-grader in the Plum Blossom Class.
Behind him, there came a high-pitch scream. 
This time, another girl. His eyes caught onto her nametag, Satsuki Yoko-chan.
Sisters? Friends? It didn't matter.
Maggots ran down its face, and it looked like it was crying. It could have been. Was it mourning the loss of its companion through life and death?
It didn't matter. Deku lifted his bat up as she came forward and swung with all his might, unassisted by his borrowed power. The small body hit the chalkboard and splattered. Dropping to the ground with a wet thunk, he took a step forward to gather the ID. As he did, the body on the ground started to convulse and launched at him. With broken arms and a destroyed spine, there wasn't much it could do other than make pitiful noises and claw at the ground. There was no need for more suffering, so Deku smashed down at its back. Spine and ribcage crunched with ease. 
He leaned down to take her nametag, and pocketed it.
First-grader Yoko-chan in the Sakura-Class.
He turned back to drag the bodies outside into the hallway and close the doors. 
The first room was clear.

-

By the time he was finished with the first floor, he felt exhausted. Given their size and statue, they were definately easier to manage than any other monster he's ever fought before. 
His arms felt heavy with every swing. 
The blood that caked him was no different than any other blood he's been caked in. It was all, in theory, the same. Monsters were monsters were monsters. He shouldn't feel any different than he normally did. 
Or rather, he stared at his trembling hands. Better him than someone important.
One floor down, three left. He needed to clear these out in the next hour or so, or else someone would come looking for him. The people he was with were foolishly kind like that.
He left his commlink in a body a street and a half away. They wouldn't come here for a while. Just a little more time. In exchange for their kindness, he would give them his dishonesty. 
He buried his guilt as he swung again. Don't think, he reminded himself. It would make this harder.
Instead, when he was done, and his footsteps were outlined on the ground by puddles of blood, he stared at the small mounds of flesh left. Small bodies wouldn't leave that much behind. He understood that in his head, but he couldn't shake it off.
Had Muscular killed Kouta back then, crushed his body and splinted his bone, it would have left about this much. 
Was it a good thing? There only turned out to be about thirty of these little guys running amok here. He hoped that the others made it out, alive and intact, and they just left behind the ones that were initially chewed out. 
The silence was only distrubed by his sticky footsteps echoing through an empty elementary school. 
[3:32 PM]

-

Deku was panting by the time he got back to the place he tossed out his commlink. About a street out, he felt a gush of air and Hawks was next to him.
"Deku, you-!"
Hawks fell silent in a second, sharp eyes narrowing as he stared at the young man.
"...Are you okay?" he asked, eyes taking in his features. His hand came up, as though to grab the young man by the shoulder and check if he was real, but Deku leaned away from the touch. "...Where were you? You didn't... answer you commlink, but we heard it break. I thought you..."
Deku couldn't help but think that he used to smile more when he called him Helmet. 
"I'm okay," he said, his voice breaking. He covered his mouth to clear his throat and tried again, "I'm okay-"
And Hawks gave this bitter laugh.
"No," he said, "No, you're not."
Deku felt something in his heart jolt and dropped his gaze. Hawks covered his eyes with a hand, but his bitter smile remained jagged on his face. He gulped as he took a deep breath.
"Well, I'm glad you're alive," he said, "and I'm sure if I ask if you're injured, you're not going to answer, right?"
Deku didn't answer.
"And if I ask what you were doing, you're not going to answer either, right?"
There was no answer.
Hawks laughed again, like he wanted to cry but the sound came out in the only way he knew how. He placed a hand on the commlink.
"Hawks reporting. Found Deku. He doesn't look injured."
He pulled the commlink out of his ear and tossed it to Deku, while the uproar flooded the small bluetooth. Deku winced, but caught it without a problem. He stared at it through the visor as he waited for the explosion of sound to quiet down.
"You hear that?" Hawks asked, "Those are all the people who want to see you again."
Deku stared at the commlink.
These were all the people that he managed to spare from the elementary school. People who were worried for some freak of nature like him. His hands trembled, feeling like the device was much heavier than anything he's ever held before.
"You should speak, and let them know that you're alive. It'll help ease thir mind a little."
Deku brought the commlink closer to his mouth, paused and then turned to Hawks.
"What... should I say?"
The blond binked at him, and a grin different to the one he had before came onto his face. 
"When you're worried, what do you want to hear?"
Deku blinked and looked down at the commlink. What he wanted to hear? Wasn't it obvious what he wanted to hear from the others?
"Threats have been eliminated," he reported. "No one is injured."
There was another second of silence before the commlink jumped with the sheer volume of people yelling into the commlink.
Further behind, Hawks covered his eyes as he laughed, a bright and glorious sound that bounced off the concrete walls and filled Deku from the inside. 
"Well, ready to head back?" Hawks asked.
Deku shook his head.
"Alright, then you should let them know."
This felt counter intuitive, like Deku was the butt of a joke he didn't even know about.
"...I'm not ready to go back," he spoke into the commlink. And fed up with it, tossed the link back to Hawks. The man caught it with a feather, and Deku turned back. 
Now that he was done with his detour, it was time to get to the part he needed to get done.

-

The thing about Deku was that, now that his helmet was broken and they could see his face, they realized that he really didn't need words. Everything was there, right on his face.
Right now, with Sasaki carefully wiping at the blood gushing from Deku's forhead, it was clear to see that he was desperately trying to get back into the fight.
"Gotta..." he muttered quietly, weakly pushing at Nighteye's hands, "before... escape..."
Shigaraki stared for a while, and wondered if he's ever had something that he wanted that badly. If there was something that he felt like he had to do, even if he died a painful and pitiful death. Deku's legs trembled and Sasaki's hand grabbed his shoulder.
"You need to rest. At least until the bleeding stops," he said.
Deku pushed back against his hand, sweat beading at his forehead as he shook his head. His breaths came out in ragged pants, and his face twisted into a scowl.
"They're bleeding, too."
And the way he said it, words rolled with certainty and drive, made Shigaraki take a step back. 
But while he spoke, everyone finally showed up to their temporary rendevous point. In different states of disarray, they all arrived wordlessly. 
Dabi's eyes lingered on the pile of bloodied bandages next to Sasaki before he spoke up.
"We'll start the fire in the parking lot," he announced, turning back to go where he came from. His jacket flourished behind him, making him look a lot cooler than he was. "Let's move."
Deku's head snapped up, eyes wide as though he never considered the thought this course of action.
"Sounds good," Sasaki said, "Be careful."
He paused for a second, blue eyes flitting from Deku to Sasaki and then the ground, "Yeah, whatever. Keep him alive," and he left.
Spinner gave a more polite nod, and followed after Dabi.
"I'll head for the roof and meet you guys down," Hawks said, opening his wings wide. "We're not going to let any of them escape." He looked to his partner for the day, "Sit this out if you're tired."
Tokoyami, who looked exahusted next to Hawks, clenched his jaw, bit back his complaints and nodded.
"I'm just getting started," he said, straightening out. 
"Then, keep up," and Hawks was gone with a gush of wind. 
"Black Shadow!"
"Roger!"
Red eyes fell to Deku, who looked around with the same awe that he saw Eri express when she saw the flowers in the garden bloom.
"We'll take the courtyard," Shigaraki said before he knew what he was saying. 
"Then, I'll-" Deku tried to stand again and Sasaki caught him.
"You'll rest for a minute before joining the fight," the man clarified. He gave Shigarki a firm nod. "Take care."
"You know us!" Twice yelled out, "//Don't tell me what to do!"

-

Shigaraki grinded his jaw down. This was beyond ridiculous. Wasn't she with someone else's group? Where did that damn hero go, leaving this girl on her own like this?
"Hey big guy!" Asido yelled out at the hulking monster. "Come and get it!" she shouted out. Jumping to dodge its whip of a tail cracking through the air. 
Shigaraki's heart sank. The fucking bimbo was attracting his attention? He cursed her out, long and hard in his head, 
"You're gonna have to work for your food!" she yelled out, clapping her hands loudly. "Is that all you got?! You can't catch any of us like that!"
Without really understanding what he was doing, he was already running towards her. There was no way she was going to beat that by herself. It just wasn't possible. It didn't matter if she moved like a monkey on steriods, that bastard moved fast. 
Shigaraki's hand came to his gun, pulling it out. Aiming carefully, he took a slow breath. Asido melted the ground in front of her, sliding down theuneven area with ease as she flipped out of the way from another hit. Spinning the monster about wildly, until the tail came and slammed on the ground. The ground splintered and she slipped with a shout.
At that point, Shigaraki fired. The bullet pierced right into the moster's eye. It screamed, and Asido wasted no time rushing at it. 
No, you idiot, Shigaraki wanted to scream, run the other way. 
Asido gave a loud warcry as she ran up. Shigaraki, overflowing with obscene curses, steadied his aim to fire at its head several more times. He honestly couldn't tell if he was making a difference, even though none of his shots missed. The monster released another ear-piercing screech that had him flinching backwards, but Asido didn't hesitate to throw a rock into its mouth instead.
"Choke on it!" she snapped out, spraying acid all over its teeth and mouth. "That's what you get for coming after Sakamata-san!"
Shigarki, whose ears were ringing, took aim again and shot it several times in the mouth.
Finally, finally, it fell to the side, unmoving. 
Asido fell backwards onto her butt, panting hard. She lifted her hand up and waved in Shigaraki's general direction.
"Good cover!" she called out. 
Shigaraki, jogging towards her, threw the monster a cautious look. "Is it actually dead?"
"I really... hope so," Asido said between gulps of air. "Oh man, that was hard!"
Just to be safe, Shigaraki placed his hand on the monster, disintegrating about half of it before his arm felt like it was splitting apart. He took his hand off and shook it wildly to get feeling back into his fingertips. At the very least, even if it somehow lived through all of that, it wouldn't be as hard to fight since it was missing the bottom half of its body. Asido, from where she was sitting, sprayed more acid on the parts that he couldn't get to.
Shigaraki covered his mouth and nose, the smell was putrid. He took a few steps back from the monster, when he heard a laugh from his side. 
Asida stared at him, and giggled behind her hands. He glared at her. The lynchpin of their current state of affairs. 
"What!" he snapped out, more than tired of the world and all its bullshit.
"I used to think that you were really scary," she said, "but in reality, you do care!"
Shigaraki jerked backwards like he had been shocked. 
"I don't care about you. Any of you."
Asido grinned back, unrepentent.
"That's why you came running, right? Didn't once stop to call for back-up. You went with what I wanted to do and backed me up."
"I-"
Shigaraki stopped, because he didn't even think about it. He just ran. He saw that shithead coming for Asido and he felt something inside of him rot so he moved faster. That was it. It wasn't because he cared. It wasn't because he wanted to do this. He just.
"I don't know!" he snapped back, "I just moved before I thought. If I knew that it was you, I would have never come to help you!"
And he hated young girls like Asido and their stupid, knowing smile.
"Shigaraki-san!" she said, getting up to give him a proper bow, "Thank you for coming to help me!"
That grin on her face. He hated it. A feeling he's never felt before wormed into his chest, enveloping on his fuzzy feeling that made the world look so damn bright.
"Get up and get moving!"
"Yes sir!" she cheered.
Shigaraki wondered when, between fighting monsters and brittle arguements, he got used to this radiance. 

-

"I heard you saved Asido when I couldn't," Sakamata approached him later, his arm in a sling and favoring his right leg. 
Shigaraki opened his mouth to say something biting. Something that would drive a stake in the former hero's heart. Something that would make Sakamata hurt and suffering like Shigaraki always felt, for as long as he could remember.
"She's stronger than you think," he said instead, remembering a person who ran towards the battle instead of away, "Fight with her next time, and no one would get hurt."
Sakamata stared at Shigaraki for a moment longer than the young man was comfortable with. A scowl on his face, he stood up to leave when a chuckle left Sakamata.
"Yes, I suppose you're right."
Being told that he was right by a hero, being agreed with by a hero that he was in the right, none of it felt as victorious as he used to think it would. The people that he lauded as stupid idiots that blindly listened and followed what they were told, told him that he was right. And still, he couldn't derive any joy in the situation.
His eyes fell to Sakamata's arm. If only he had gotten there earlier. Combined between Sakamata, who could ruin the perception of anyone, and a disintigrating duo between Asido and Shigaraki, they could have had a perfect run where no one was injured.
Instead...
"Still, though, thank you."
And instead, Shigaraki was left with that awful feeling that he didn't want to know what a world without these idiots would be like. 
"...Whatever, don't mention it."
Shigaraki felt like he was lacking something. 

### Rotting 

Stomach rolling, Midoriya teetered too far to the side. His feet were unsteady, and right when he thought he was going to fall, a pair of arms caught him.
"Easy," a voice murmured out, "I have you."
Midoriya's eyes widened and he jerked backwards. He didn't get too far, with his unstable legs and spinning head, and Hawks' hands holding his arms. 
"H-Hawks-"
"I know you don't trust me," the blond said, "but until someone you do trust comes, I won't let anything happen to you."
Midoriya shivered, because it wasn't that he didn't trust him, really.
"W-Why are you here?" he said instead. It proved to be a mistake, as he felt like the ground was suddenly rushing for his head. He gave a quiet groan, a hand coming to his head, and Hawks took a step closer.
"Of course I came," the blond muttered quietly, sounding too good to be true. Maybe Midoriya was hallucinating. "C'mon, I'm getting you to the doctor-"
"Room," Midoriya said, shaking his head. His hand came to grip the front of Hawks' shirt. "Quickly."
The blond stared at him for a moment longer before he leaned in to press a kiss to his forehead. "Understood," he muttered.

-

Midoriya opened his eyes blearily. Despite his soft, fluffy, and warm bed, he felt exhausted. The sunlight poured in from the windows, already telling him that it was late in the morning. He must have completely slept in.
A massive arm laid across his waist, and he weakly pushed at it. The hand suddenly snapped off of him, and a weight moved next to him. Midoriya leaned towards the new dip in the bed, and looked up at All Might's worried gaze.
"...Good morning," Midoriya said, feeling the exhaustion ebb just a little bit.
All Might's blue eyes softened like a melting ore, and his large hand came up to his forehead.
"Indeed," he replied back, "How are you feeling?"
"Tired," the young prince replied, taking All Might's hand into his own and pulling it down to his cheek. He gave a little hum, "And I'm hungry."
"That's good, having an appetite is a good sign," the blond said, kissing his forehead. 
"What can I get you for breakfast?"
The sudden voice had Midoriya sitting up. Eyes wide, a quiet squeak of a voice strangled out of his throat in surprise.
"Oops," Hawks rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, "Should I have said good morning first?"
"Hawks, you're still here?" All Might asked, totally unbothered by all his appearance. 
"I just got here," the blond said, "I felt you wake up."
Midoriya eyed the scattered feathers on the ground, and felt his heartrate start to calm down.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to alarm you," he continued, looking a bit apologetic. "Could I come closer?"
Midoriya stared at him, the hopeful gleam in his eyes, and nodded.
"I'm sorry for putting you in that spot yesterday," he said.
"You don't have to apologize to me," Hawks replied, crossing the space between them in a second. While Midoriya gave him the permission to come closer, he wasn't expecting the blond to come right to the bed he was and kneel in front of him. "I'm glad that I was able to be of use to you."
"...You don't have to say it like that," Midoriya said, probably too tired to really understand what he was talking about. 
Something about waking up next to All Might made his heart into a melted puddle, and it loosened his guard. Otherwise, he would have never said anything like this to the man. 
"You're more than a tool to be used," he said, yawning. Slowly, he pushed himself off his bed and slowly made his way to his closet. What should he wear today?
"Does that mean... you aren't going to use me anymore?"
"Huh?" Midoriya blinked, and then shook his head, "I never planned on using you in the firt place. You and I, we're allies."
"What if I want to be more than allies?"
"Like ... friends?" Midoriya could hope.
The blond stared at him. "I want to hold you, even when you're not sick. I want to be called without it being a mistake. I want to stand by your side because you want me and not because some contract makes you feel obligated to me."
The way he spoke, it felt like he was holding onto these words for a long time.
Hawks ran his hand through his hair, looking as frustrated as Midoriya felt on a good day.
"I don't know what to do so that you can trust me. You're not telling me what I can do so I can become as precious to you as you are to me."
"Hawks, I-"
"Is that selfish? Am I asking for too much?"
"I'm not..." Midoriya hesitated, feeling overwhelmed as he took a shaky step back, "I just... I thought you wanted to be free."
Hawks followed him, his wings folded behind him and the longer feathers dragging on the ground. Confident steps dogged Midoriya's awkward shuffling, until his back was to the wall and Hawks was less than a foot away.
"I told you what I want. Please, tell me what you want."
"Is it okay?" Midoriya asked quietly, "I-"
"Tell me what you want," Hawks said, kneeling in front of him, "And I will make it come true."
"Then," Midoriya hesitated, "I... What I want... What I really want...?"
Hawks stared at him and nodded. Further way, slowly dressing himsel fand otherwise watching with
What Midoriya wanted? 
What did he want? It felt like everything he did was a reaction to whatever nosncense the world threw at him. Did living count? He wanted to live, did that count? At the focus of Hawks' stare, he didn't think so.
He opened his mouth, finding an answer much easier than he thought.
"I want you to be happy."
Hawks surged up to his feet, "Excuse me, then," he said, before kissing Midoriya. He left as fast as he came, and after a pause, came back to kiss him again. Midoriya's hands flew to his arms, feeling Hawks' hard arms felx under his touch, and briefly wondered how good it would feel to be pinned down underneath him-
Hawks' tongue wrapped around his, sucking hard and stopping all of Midoriya's thoughts. Eventually, the blond pulled away, panting hard as his eyes remained trained on Midoriya's face. He waited, for Midoriya to slowly open his eyes, before he spoke clearly.
"Thank you," he said.
It gave him a lot of mixed emotions.
"I... I'll go and cool off," Hawks said, stepping back.
As though pulled by an unseen force, Midoriya stepped forward. His hand caught onto Hawks' hand.
"I... Uh..."
Golden eyes met his, surprise coloring his face.
"Safe trip, and... come by for dinner."
The taller man seemed to melt. Lifting Midoriya's hand to his lips, he kissed his knuckles.
"Okay. I can do that."
