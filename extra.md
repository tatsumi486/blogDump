Midoriya sat on the ground in front of the closet, staring at the purple smear of color swirling in front of him. 
It was possible, he realized.
Once he cleared the dungeon, they could all be reset. The people involved could be released from this. Like a game. Like a quirk. 
The best case scenario. The Happy Ending.
Midoriya covered his face. Even more than before, he knew he had to clear the dungeon.
For everyone else's sake.
And at the end of this dungeon, he would properly apologize. Turn in his license, drop out or transfer out of UA. He'd apologize to Yagi for lying to him, and hand over One For All without a fuss. And then he and his mom could disappear away as though they never existed. Maybe he could learn to farm. Or the could leave Japan and go somewhere else, like Peru or Laos or wheverever had the beaches that made his mom sigh so happily. 
Midoriya took a deep breath. Endure it, he told himself. He would do it. He could do anything.
Efficiently, to clear this dungeon as fast as possible, he would do it. 
He couldn't be a hero, but he would finish what he started.

Jin blew a raspberry against his ear, and Midoriya gave a breathless gasp. He jerked to the side, his hand on his ear.
"Don't look so down," the blond said, a wide grin on his face, "You'll miss what's in front of you."
Midoriya stared back at him, eyes wide.
Jin looked forward and down the hall, "Man, you really can't see an end here," he said. "I'm not much of a help, but I'll be here for you."

"Deku."
Midoriya flinched, and he turned around to where Bakugo stared back at him.
"... Aren't you tired of being a charity case?"
The young man pulled his shoulders back, and clenched his jaw shut.
"What's the matter?" he asked, "Nothing to say? Too busy kissing ass so you can't even think of something to say?"
But the thing was, Midoriya couldn't think of anything to say. It wasn't like he was wrong. Bakugo had every right, and then some, to criticize him. Him and everyone else, who came here to become heroes and instead had Midoriya wasting their energy and time. 
"Nothing to say? You think you can just ignore me now?!" the explosion was something he was used to, but it didn't frieghten him as much as it used to.

"So it's you?" Spinner asked. 
"Me?"
"Stain-san sent me to protect you."
"Protect... me?" Midoriya squinted, "From what?"
Spinner stared back, "Your name is on a hit list," he explained. "And I won't let Stain-san down."
"B-but-"
Who was this?
"Why's my name on a hitlist?"
"I don't know," Spinner replied, "but Stain-san risked his life to protect you. So I will too."
"...That doesn't sound like Stain-san sent you," Midoriya said quietly.
"Don't fret the details, hero-kun," he replied, eyes bright and clearly not hearing anything other than what he wanted to hear. "I will protect Stain-san's ideal!"
And Midoriya wondered if he had 

>> in reality, stain didn't hire spinner, spinner just wanted to catch stain's eye so here he is. 
>> midoriya's quiet band of mercs that are doing shit for him

Well yeah, Yamada thought. His close-combat was ass. If he were in Midoriya's shoes, he would try to take Aizawa and Kan too. He stared at the gate, sitting so innocently at the back of the empty closet. 
He looked at Midoriya.

-

"Aizawa," Yamada said, leaning against his desk. Right before Aizawa could snap at him, the blond gave him this smile, one that Aizawa hadn't seen in a while and only associated with bad things. "...It's been a while, let's get some drinks after work."
His long-time friend looked at him for a moment and then nodded. 
"Yeah," he said, "Sounds good."
His friend gave him a tight smile, and Aizawa frowned. He would let Midoriya know that he would be late tonight.
