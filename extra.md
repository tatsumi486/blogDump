>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

# backline tanker

> Dating Midoriya Izuku was like a dream. Dating the Number One Supporter was more of a headache. Natsuo sorta wished that the world would leave them alone.

Everyone, even civilians who weren't in the know-how of Hunter Society, knew of All For One.
He was practically a walking legend. The living only person that had seen the rise of Hunter Society, the only living person who knew what the world was like before Hunter Society.
As old as he was powerful, he was in charge of an international guild, with a headquarters in Tokyo, Japan.

Kan leaned against the door. Covering his face, he sighed.
Left because he couldn't control himself? That didn't even begin to describe it. He flexed his hand into a fist and then relaxed it. He didn't want to scare Midoriya. He didn't want to show that he was 
After all

Shigaraki hovered over him, and Jin's words echoed inside of him.
There was a chance that emotions and actions were governed by the artifacts. It was a large chance, since this was something that would never have happened if it weren't for the item.
"It's okay," Midoriya said, "Do whatever you want."
"I..."
Shigaraki stared.
"What?"
With Jin's words, Midoriya found liberation. A smile on his face, he reached his hand out to Shigaraki's face. The older man flinched, but Midoriya slowly ran his fingers against the dry skin by his cheek, right by his eye. 
"It's okay. I don't mind," he said, because it doesn't matter and for all he knew, all of this would end and they'll wake up at the end of it like a dream. Doesn't that sound great? Everyone could be so happy. And he could wake up, and the people who were strangers would still be strangers, and his mom could hold him, rub his back and tell him what a silly kid he was, frightened by things that weren't real. 
So who cared? Who would notice? If he lied and lied and lied and lied. And from the inside, he would rot away into nothing, but that was fine. Midoriya understood now. He got it. And what a better way to understand than by a dream created by a spell and a desperate wish to save someone he wasn't even sure was where he was looking? The whole world was right, Midoriya wouldn't fight it anymore.
He smiled at Shigaraki.
"Thank you for coming back."
Midoriya was not a hero.
"I feel like I'm always waiting for you."
And all that was left was waking up.
In this ugly dream, created from pain and a child's longing to be someone's hero, Shigaraki leaned against his hand.
"I treat you like shit," he said quietly.
No, Midoriya thought. Shigaraki treated him exactly how he deserved to be treated. Or maybe, he treated him too well, since he always returned. What a convenient dream.
"No you don't," he said, taking his hand to push Shigaraki's hair back and away fom his eyes. "If you think that, if you really think that, then you haven't treated me badly at all."

Shigaraki stared at his screen.
Staring back at him were flat-chested beauties, all big, wide eyes,and hair so green it could be black. It wasn't that he had a type or anything, of course, these were reputable games that had been touted and totally deserving of their high ratings. Anyone else that thought otherwise was probably some dirty hero-lover. 
More importantly, they were correct. Treating someone like garbage was the way to the True End. Now that the flag had led him to the confession scene.
He stared at the images shining on the screen in front of him. He tapped his fingers on the keys, not enough to press them down, but just enough so that there was a sound. 
What did he need to do to protect the epilogue?
He snorted. Him? Protect anything?
He was a villain. What could he protect? He looked at his hands. if he had something that he wanted to protect, that was a weakness waiting to be exploited. He wasn't some monkey that thought with his dick. He was better than that.
Sensei said something like this, didn't he? That when quirks first started, villains and heroes didn't just pop out of the ground. Heroes pointed their fingers and said that he was a villain. The people who wanted to protect something so much that they staked their life on it-those were the real villains. People who didn't care about the greater good or the betterment of society. Be it their comfort or their happiness or their loved one, there was something that meant more than the entire world.
A long time ago, those were the real villains in the world. It was such an old story that Sensei had told him. He didn't get it then. What Sensei was trying to explain to him. What Sensei when he said that the world would become what he wanted it to be. That the world was just waiting for him to take it and swallow it whole. 
He closed his eyes. Thought about an easy lay who never told him to leave. Thought about a spring that looked a little more wilted. Thought and thought and thought. 
Think, Shigaraki.
What did he want?
