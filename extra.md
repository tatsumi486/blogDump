"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

Midoriya leaned backwards onto Dabi's desk, looking at the wall behind Dabi's chair while the man continued working. He was humming something or another, and Dabi risked a glance up. He gave a small smile and he leaned back against his chair. Pushing just a little bit back, he caught Midoriya's attention.
Grabbing the young man's arm, he yanked him over his lap. 
Midoriya yelped, his hand flying out to the armrests of the chair instead of falling into Dabi's lap, but that was fine. Dabi chuckled, never failing to find joy when he saw his favorite shade of green, and yanked him over.
"Wha-Dabi-You-"
Within a few seconds, Midoriya was situated comfortably over his lap. His legs were over the armrest and his shoulder leaning against Dabi's chest. Long arms wrapped around his chest as he gave him a knowing smile.
"You looked like you wanted to sit down," he explained.
Midoriya should have spluttered and flustered, possibly given a couple of quips about the impropriety of this, maybe some more bickering that Dabi would use as a preamble to having hot, sexy, sex on top of his desk and all of the stupid reports he had to read to. 
Instead, Midoriya was silent. 
The older man frowned, an enroaching fear creeping up from inside of him that Midoriya was just pretending that everything was okay and he was stupid enough to believe it. 
But Midoriya's neck was red. His ears were red. He paused, and that cold feeling came back. Was he sick?
"...Izuku," he said, voice low as to not surprise him, and blinked when he was suprrised in turn at the shiver that ran down Midoriya's spine.
Oh.
A grin stretched across his lips. He knew what was up.
"Oh, Izuku," he purred, kissing the back of his neck and wrapping his arms around him tighter when he shivered again. "What's the matter?" he purred out. "Is something wrong?"
"I-I-" Midoriya's blushed, and he covered his face.
Dabi hummed, kissed the top of his head, and waited.
"Well?" he prompted.
Midoriya's hands moved down just a little bit, so that Dabi could see those green eyes.
"You're just..."
"I'm just..."
"You're just really handsome!" Midoriya shouted out, unable to bear with it anymore. He placed his hands over his heart, "I felt my heart skip a beat!"
Bright blue eyes widened before the man threw his head back and laughed. 
"Stop laughing!" Midoriya whined back. 
Dabi kissed him then, his laughter still ringing in his heart making his lips taste so sweet against his.

"Wha... What the hell were we supposed to do?! We didn't want to die! We don't want to die! But what else could we fucking do?!" the man slammed his fist to the ground, "We aren't like you! We didn't get our quirks back! We're not strong!"
And Deku, who fought till he didn't know if he was alive or dead, wouldn't understand that. Winning a fight had nothing to do with strength or quirks. Or maybe it was different for people who remembered what the world was like before it fell apart. 
Still, he didn't think he could ever excuse this.
He looked at their hands and mouth, stained with blood, and wondered what would excuse this. If he was in their shoes, would he have made the same decisions? In another time, in another place, was this something he could do to another person?
No matter how much he turned it in his head, he couldn't get an answer. He lifted his bat and decided that he would rather regret killing them than regret letting them live. He lifted his bat.
Their underserving mercy would come from a swift death.

-

The door slammed open and Endeavor came in then. The people behind him, immediately flanked out behind him.
"Deku!" he called out, stepping up to him as he eyed the bloodied mess around him. He grimaced, no doubt the most he could mourn the death of another person, and turned back to him. "You alright?"
His arms felt numb. Deku wished he was worthy of the concern in his eyes. The blood dripped off of his bat, feeling as though the it was echoing through the room. 
He nodded at him, but he couldn't muster the energy to otherwise move.
"...Deku?"
"E-Endeavor-san?!"
One of the supply closets broke open and a man came stumbling out of it. 
"Endeavor-san!"
A man, similar to the ones on the ground in clothing and bloodstains, came limping over. On instinct, Endeavor moved to stand in front of Deku, gun already drawn and ready to fire. 
"Stand back!"
"Wait, wait, Endeavor-san! You got the wrong person! The person behind you is the one-!"
A loud gunshot came at the ground, and Endeavor readjusted his posture to aim for the chest this time.
"Stand back."
As though understanding their position now, the stranger took a step back. Hands up and tears flowing down his face, the man cried out.
"Please Endeavor, please, help me. The person you should be pointing your gun at is the guy behind you! Do you know what he did?! He killed everyone here! He killed my senpais even though we had already surrendered!"
The man dropped to his hands and knees, before placing his head down on the ground.
"Please! Endeavor-san! The only monster here is the person behind you!"
And then, to Deku behind Endeavor, yelled out, "Your time is over now, you monster! I won't let you get away with killing Matsumoto-senpai and Kirei-senpai!"
Just as fast, a black smoke came out from Deku's arm and grabbed the man. Right when he was about to snap is neck, Endeavor's gun fired. Blood splattered out on the ground and Deku's air whip disappeared like it was never there.
A frown stretched his lips as he looked at the older man. 
"Enji, you didn't need to-"
The older man turned around so sharply that his words caught in his mouth. Eyes so bright they looked like they were glowing, he spoke surprisingly quietly.
"You're right. I didn't need to. This is a burden I wanted to share with you," he said. "Please, do not take this from me."
Deku stared at him and then back down to the ground.
Enji, who was willing to kill someone in cold blood, who was willing to kill someone who was begging for help, who was willing to kill so that Deku wouldn't be alone, was someone so kind that Deku felt like he would wilt and break under his tender care.
But the worst of it all was that Deku undoubtedly felt happy at such attention. 
He had never realized before how exhausting it was to be alone. 
It made him feel vulnerable and weak, all in one.

-

"Deku?" 
Deku's head snapped up, and Fuyumi felt a little bad at startling him so bad.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you."
Green eyes blinked at her and he brought his eyes down. Shaking his head, he gave a shallow bow. 
"A-Are you here to see Dad?" she asked quietly.
He stared at the door where Enji was behind and his jaw clenched tightly. Ultimately, he shook his head. 
"I think he'd like your company," she said, a kind smile on her face.
Her, like all Todoroki's seemed to, had a fraying relationship with Enji. Still, her smile was patient. More than how she felt or Enji's comfort, the person in front of her was her priority. If he was here, there was a reason for it, even if it was to just alleviate his concern.
"Really?" he asked, and in these moments, she's reminded how young he was.
"Yes," she smiled back, "I'm sure of it." 
He hesitated still, "I can come back," he said, even though he was staring at the door again. "I won't interupt-"
"Nonscense, you can't interupt!" she said, knocking on the door and calling out, "Dad, it's Fuyumi and Deku."
"Come in."
She opened the door, and smiled at Deku, who looked a litle wary, but came too. 
"How are you feeling?" Fuyumi asked as she entered.
"I'm fine," Enji said, his eyes glued to Deku's figure, "I'll be cleared after dinner."
She nodded as she made her way to the seat next to Enji and then, paused. She motioned for Deku to take the seat instead. "Deku, come sit here." She grabbed the cups. "I'll go get

"You know, what's really nice about him is that he isn't a liar."
"It's his only redeeming quality," Natsuo grouched.
Fuyumi giggled, her hand coming to Deku's back and she smiled back.
"So, I promise you. He cares about you."
Deku's heart ached, and wondered if he'd be as strong as that. Would he ever be strong enough to look at Enji and be okay not accepting his love and affection? He couldn't imagine it. 
"I'm sorry," he said, his voice breaking. "I'm sorry for taking him."
"No, not at all," Fuyumi's words sounded so genuine, her touch was so warm, and Deku hated how much comfort he soaked from her kindness. "On the contrary, Deku. Thank you for bringing him to us."
From experience, Midoriya knew. It would be easier if they hated him and hit him. It would be preferable if they screamed and raged and in fact, he would have welcomed it. It would have been easier. He knew how to handle that.
Instead, this warm feeling seemed into his heart. She ran her long fingers through his hair, and a large hand came to rub his back. His throat burned, and he didn't understand. His hands trembled, and his eyes watered. He couldn't do this. He covered his face, embaressed and ashamed.
"I'm sorry," he croaked out. "I'm sorry."
Because how dare he find comfort after all he did? All the things he destroyed and all the people he killed, but he still found happiness? It was inconcievable. It was beyond disrespectful. The feeling clawed at his chest, sharp talons digging into his heart, and he didn't know what to do. He didn't know how to start.
Because deep in his greed-infested heart, he knew he wouldn't let Enji go for anything.

### way back home

"There's a proper use for everything," Midoriya said.
Twice looked up, "Even me?"
And the grin that this kid, a stranger that stuck his nose where it didn't belong, made him feel like he was stepping out into the light for the first time.
"The fun of living is trying to figure that out, right?" he reached his hand out, "I'm sure you'll be fine."
And if people could choose what their use was, and if people could think and believe and just have things work out the way they wanted it to-
then Twice decided, then and there, that he wanted to be [of use] to Midoriya.
Because the planets orbit the sun for a reason that Twice couldn't remember, but they did and that was the point.

"Did you know?" Midoriya asked kindly, "The character for 'palm' means the 'mind of the hand'."
He grabbed Sato's fist, and tugged on his fingers until it opened up.
"When this fist opens up to a palm," he said, "You can do a lot more. You can... climb trees and do the laundry, cook and bake and..." He gave a grin as he pressed his palm against Sato's, "and even give your friend a high-five."
Sato stared at him for a long, long moment.
"I tried to beat you up," he said.
"Yeah."
"Aren't you... angry?"
Midoriya's arm, where it was broken and hanging loosely next to him, throbbed.
"I am," he confirmed. 
"Then..."
"Sato," he called, a smile on his face, "I

The problem was that these reports weren't filled out properly. It was easy to imagine, some officer had to finish up the "mising-case" and since there's no proper way to describe how a child escaped a kidnapper on their own, it was better (and easier on resourceS) that they wrote it off as a a runaway.
Well no, that wasn't the probem.
The problem was Aizawa, who read that report and believed it. 
He covered his face with his hand. He had a lot to do, starting with an apology.
