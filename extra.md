It was a strange thing to forget. The thought that they did forget didn't even occur to them until they were reminded of it. The aggressive, almost violent way that Deku carried himself was as terryfying as it was awe-inspiring.

Midoriya stared at the spell for a long, long time, and then shook his head.
"I don't want to dispell it."
"But you could?" Natsuo asked, staring up at the coffin. "I don't doubt it, I don't think there anything you can't do but..." he looked back at him. "What's up?"
"...We can break the gem up there," Midoriya said, pointing to the shining crystal closer to the top of the casket. "And that should cut the magic link and kill the boss."
"Sounds good," Touya said, taking a step back and charging his shot. "Step back."
Natsuo deployed a shield, Midoriya casted a simple charm, and between the two of them, there would be no debris or lasting curse to hurt them. It would be a perfect clear.
"I could have done it," Twice mumbled.
"Maybe if you grow another inch," Touya replied back, a grin on his face as Twice flipped him off.

"What do you mean that you didn't want to dispell it?" Touya asked as they finished their meal. 
Midoriya stared at the table in front of him and then shook his head.
"When you break a [curse] you need to either have the same amount of magic and cast it sooner, or you need double the magic it has at the time you're tying to break it."
"Uh... so basically you can break any spell that's half what you have," Natsuo said. "You have to be twice as strong as everything else."

"It's worth it," Ban Yeoryung cried. She wiped at her eyes and rubbed them hard, even red-rimmed, they were breathtaking. Fat tears ran down her face and the words came out strangled, and still, she was beautiful. "It doesn't hurt. I can do it."
"...Yeoryung?" Dan-i whispered back. As the main lead, she supposed it wouldn't be this easy.
"I'll protect it. The world where-where we eat ice cream together. The world where we s-sleep next to each other. I'll do it," she said. "I'll protect the world that I share with my Dan-i."
Dan-i, on occasion, wondered what had happened in their past, that this beautiful woman was so loyal to her. The original Ham Dan-i must have been someone equally beautiful to have earned that loyalty. 
"Yeo-ryung," she said, collecting her hands, and smiled. "Having you here is enough for me." She leaned in, pushing her long hair behind her ear, and grinned. "Every day I get to spend with you is my most precious treasure."
