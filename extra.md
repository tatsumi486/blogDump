"Izuku! There you are! What are you thinking, keeping me waiting? Such a silly omega, that's why everyone calls you a 'Deku'!" 
Dabi frowned, and stepped forward. The fire already collected at his fingers, and he narrowed his eyes. This guy is dead. Just. Dead. They don't need people who were going to put down their leader. 
But before Dabi's fire got to him, Izuku spoke up with a simple question.
"Do you know who Midoriya Inko is?"
"Do I-" the man spluttered, afronted that such a thing was asked, "Of course I know who my wife is! That's your mother, you know! Why are you calling her by her name! You still haven't learned your manners? That's why you're still unbonded. All these alphas and they would rather be alone than be with you-"
Izuku handed him a ID card, and suddenly, Dabi understood.
"My condolensces."
The man took the card in his shaky hands, and Izuku turned around.
"W-What-what the hell is this?!" he screamed out, "Get back here and explain this, Izuku! I said, get back here!"
But not even an alpha's [command] could make Izuku do anything. He didn't even pause, and moved as though nothing had been said at all.
If it were true, Dabi wondered how Izuku had saddled with the weight of his mother's blood on his hands this whole time. He thought about Izuku, who snuck extra snacks for the children on base (did he really think that Dabi wouldn't notice?), kept tabs on popular recreational activities for people to do, never hesitated to spend more time looking for lost-causes, who walked forward with a blank expression. 
"Damn, the bastard is still screaming."
"He's mourning," Izuku replied, "It's to be expected."
What about you? Dabi asked. Even if that man and that ID-card wasn't his dad and mom, Izuku must have lost the same amount every other civilian lost from the start of this to now, right? They've lost a few since they started living here too. Did he mourn? 
Or was he more like Dabi? Did Izuku only gain things since he made a base here?
The questions lodged in his throat. Even if he did get an answer, he knew that their relationship wouldn't change. 
But the thought that Izuku would share anything about himself, had his heart teetering dangerously and that blasted feeling -hope- came creeping up. Pathetic didn't even begin to describe how he felt.

-

"Normally, you ask the omega's father or mother, whichever is the alpha, and ask them for their omega's hand in marriage," Aizawa explained, "so, in those terms, it's important to know if he's actually your dad or not."
"Shame omegas don't have opinions or feelings of their own," Izuku added, "It'd make life a lot simpler."
As though waiting for this, Shigaraki sat up.
"I didn't care," he said, almost bragging. 
Izuku and Aizawa ignored him.
"What do you think?"
"It'd be nice if my mate's parents liked me," he said, "It's not nessesary, and it's not like, just because they don't like me, I'm going to give up on my mate. It's just a formality, really."
The omega looked at the ground, but didn't say anything more.
"If my mate trusts me and loves me, that's all I need," Aizawa concluded. "What about you?"
There was a moment of silence before he spoke up. "I never really thought about it," he said. "It's not like I had anything to do with the decision, no atter what I said." He tilted his head to the side and gave a small smile, like there was something parituclarly amusing about this entire thing. He admitted, "I guess it's because omegas don't have opinions or feelings of their own."
He chuckled at his own joke, but Aizawa failed to find the humor of it.
"I don't get why it's funny," Shigaraki blurted out. "And I don't really get anything about this," he waved his hand out, "I have your back, you have mine. What more do you need?"
The look the former gave him was withering.
"You're right," Izuku murmured, his gaze turning far-away. "What more do I need?"
