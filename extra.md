"You want to be free, right?" Midoriya asked, eyes gentle. "It's alright. I don't blame you."
He looked at the assailant, he looked young.
Death by stabbing. It wasn't the worst way to go, and all things considered, this was probably bettter. 
"Get out of here quickly," he said. "Or else you will face a life worse than death."
"Why... Why are you letting me go?"
"When we're hurt, we hurt others. It's alright. I don't blame you. So run away and forget all of this.

An omega that smelled like blood would be the omega that Shigaraki couldn't stop staring at. 

### Way Back Home

["this isn't your world"]
Midoriya woke up, tears streaming from his eyes. He sat up, fingers coming up to his eyes and he took a deep breath.
Today too, he was in the wrong place.


"Well, whatever you want, I'm certain you'll get there," Miruko said, certain like the sun.
When Midoriya looked up at her, she grinned back down.
"Look, hard work pays off."
And somehow, being told that after the long hiking journey hit him differently.
His eyes welled with tears. His body was that pleasant kind of tired, where he worked it out just enough, and his heart felt calm. He sniffled as he looked over the horizon.
The world would look the exact same, but they would be incredibly different. The skyline with Miruko was one that he would probably never see again, not in his world where Miruko couldn't...
He looked out.
"Everyone..." his voice cracked, but he kept going, "says that. That I'll get everything that I want."
And his heart felt like it was going to fold in on itself and crumple, like a house made of cards. 
His hands trembled, because success meant goodbye.
These days, no matter how hard he berated himsef for stealing what wasn't his, the words began to rang hollow even in his own ears.

There was a simple way to test it. There was such a simple way to do it, but it required courage. Izuku didn't have that.
He placed his hand over his heart and dug his fingers into the skin.If courage could be derived from pain, he would have copious amounts of it.
Shaking his head, Izuku sighed, sick of disappointing himself. this was ridiculous. This shouldn't bother him so much. He was fine. He could take on groups of eight monsters altogether, but he was suddenly mute when it came to asking for some assitance.
No, that wasn't what bothered him.
What bothered him, what scared him, wasn't that. It was the expectations that would come afterwards. The undeniable certainty that indeed, Izuku could not do this by himself.


It spelled out a bad time for him if his bat was already broken. 

-

There had to be something. He can't fuck with this. If this backfires, they'll lose their best baiting trap here. Not for the first time, he wished that the internet wasn't down. If only he could just fucking Google it.
["Does an omega's scent change when they're pregnant?"]
He wanted to say no. He so desperately wanted to say no. He didn't want anything else about his life to be defined by being an omega. He flipped through the book, and no dice. Just the same things, over and over again.
[Omegas release phermones that can cause a rise in primal urges...]
[Omegas have no control over their state and need proper care and management...]
He covered his face. Waited for his boiling rage to shimmer down. Useless. Everything here was useless. At this point, he would just have to test it.
For a fact, he knew that once an omega was bonded, their alpha was pretty much the only person that could smell them. It wasn't that they stopped smelling, but it was pretty muted, and the scent of their union was the main smell that people smelled. From what he understood, after bonding, if the alpha died, the omega would probably die if they didn't have another alpha bond them. But obviously, in a world where alphas where expected to have several omegas, alphas were fine even if they killed the omegas that they were bonded with.
But how much of that was reality and how much of that was just an agenda?
Izuku rubbed his face harder. This whole thing was such fucking bullshit.

-

"...Izuku," Chisaki said, "Look at me." He made a motion at Kurono, and the man lifted up his index finger. "While looking at me, can you tell me how many fingers Hari has up?"
A slow smile, one filled with bitter regrets, stretched Izuku's lips. It told Chisaki enough. The older man covered his face and took a deep breath, while Kurono's arms dropped to his side. 
"Forget about it," Izuku said.
"It's your eye!" he snapped back. "Half your eyesight! I can't-I can't heal that! do you understand-"
Izuku stood up, deciding that this conversation was over. 
"This one works," he said, pointing at his working eye. "And so does this one," he continued, pointing at Chisaki.
Chisaki's jaw tightened considerably. "You're awful. A devil with the face of an angel."


-

"Hm? Izuku-san? Uh, Izuku-chan?" Kaminari stammered out, but Izuku didn't give him a second glance. The taller man made a quick 180 so that they were walking in the same direction. "Are you going through here?" he asked, "Lemme get the door for you-"
Nearly tripping over his own foot, he rushed to the door. Pushing it open, he turned back to Izuku with a sheepish smile.
He threw a wary glance at the man, eyed his uncertain smile, and gave a curt nod. Kaminari's smile was so bright that Izuku's steps faltered.

"I thought you couldn't get re-assessed."
"They made an exception," Midoriya explained it quietly and patiently, "because we need the Best."
"But why does it have to be you?"
And Midoriya beamed back.
"Because I wanted to protect the place where I met you."
Natsuo remembered those times with shame. After all, it was from a time where he didn't know better and didn't realize that happiness was something he could have too. His face crumpled with the guilt and the disgust because Midoriya smiled like he remembered something lovely when in reality, he only remembered Natsuo.

Japan had over 100 milion people, what was the liklihood that 10 S-Rankers selected to go on the raid would include Midoriya?
It made his heart ache.

-

"Natsuo," Touya opened his mouth to speak once Midoriya was gone. "Do you think that you're the only one being left behind?"

-

"So, where do I put it?"
"Put what?"
Hawks gave a blinding grin as he waved the manilla folder in his hand.
"You're looking for people in the build, right? I'm here with my application," he said, a patient smile on his face as he eyed Midoriya. "Where should I put it?"
"But you're a tank. With your own guild."
"Yeah, but you're here."
Midoriya flushed, his cheeks turning pink. "Oh," he said, quiet as he fiddled with his hoodie's laces. "But uhm... I-I thought that you wouldn't want to, since you..." he trailed off. Looking back up at Hawks for just a second before his gaze dropped to the ground and curled in a little more on himself. "i thought that that mission was over."
"...It is," he said, "so I'm here." He grinned at him, charming and bright as he laid his heart on the line, "I want to be with you."
Midoriya Izuku turned this shade of cherry red that had Hawks licking his lips. 
"Even if you don't want to take on my application for a fulltime position, consider inviting me for some gates."
"I don't think we could match your salary..."
"That's fine. I have more than enough money," the blond said, waving his hand. "I just want to spend some time with you."

-

"Augh," Natsuo's nose crinkled with his disgust, "Hawks came by again? Doesn't he have anything better to do?"

-

"...I'm sorry, what?"
"My mana keeps him calm," Midoriya said, "So he'll be coming around with me until he can get situated."
Natsuo spluttered, and looked at the man behind Midoriya. Just a head smaller than him, but a good couple inches taller than Midoriya, an unfamiliar blond stood behind the young man.
Augh, Midoriya and his blonds.

-

"...My name is Aizawa Shota," he said, and then motioned to the man behind him, "This is Yamada Hizashi."
"Y-Yes, hello," Natsuo almost smacked himself. Why was he hesitating? He cleared his throat and pulled his shoulders back. He was the tank. He needed to keep focus.
"We're here to apply to join Midoriya's group."
"We're not taking any applications," Natsuo snapped back.
Aizawa scowled, "I'm not asking you."
"Hey, Shota, we're not here to fight," Yamada whispered out to him. "Chill out, will you?"
The older man gave a frustrated sigh, but dipped his head forward.
"I'm sorry about my friend," Yamada said, "The truth is, we're here because we heard that you guys found Shirakumo."
"...Shirakumo?" Natsuo repeated. He thought back to the quiet blond that tried to fold himself behind Midoriya. "Huh?"
"...Maybe we should start there then."
"We're here to


Natsuo, thinking that they would take Shirakumo off their hands, accepted them with open arms. Never once did he think the three of them would make a home at the guild office instead.

-

"Throw these away," Touya said, his voice a quiet murmur, as he passed a thick packet towards the other man, "and don't let Izuku see them."
Shirakumo frowned as he took the packet of letters from him, "What are they?" he asked.
"Requests to find missing hunters."
The blond's brow furrowed and he looked up at Touya with a frown. the older man shrugged back.
"The liklihood of returning when Midoriya is a participating member of the Raid is 110%," he explained, "Needless to say, there are a lot of people who believe that their missing hunter is just lost in a gate, waiting to be saved."
Shirakumo and Touya, the only recorded people in history to get stuck in a gate, and return out alive through another gate. A hundred different investigations were undergoing around the world, just because of this, and only a few questions have been answered. Undoubtedly, as the people that had been found, and had choosen to take Midoriya's hand to come back, they had some part in these kinds of things.
"...Is that so," Shirakumo said quietly, taking it into his hands.
The weight of all their hopes and dreams to find people was less than three pounds.
"It's heavy," he said.

-

Jin's hands were tight on Midoriya's shoulders.
"Be careful," he stressed. "Just because they're handsome doesn't mean that you should just accept anyone, okay?"
"Hey, I brought back some ice cream," Hawks called out when he returned to their office, "Anyone want any?"
"Me!" Jin shouted, raising his hands excitedly. "I do!"
The look of disgust Natsuo shot him went unnoticed.

-

"...Hey, is our guild going to be okay?" Natsuo asked one day.
From behind a pile of paperwork, Aizawa bared his teeth.
"It better be."

Gilgamesh stared down at her, and Gudako did her best to look anywhere but him. The dark look in his eyes, coupled with the bags under his eyes, contrasted the smile on his face as he leaned against her desk. Red eyes glowed for just a second as he took in her features.
"Mongrel," he said, voice so low that it felt criminal. 
"I don't know."
