### kingless, quirkless
civilian -> squire -> knight -> [oath] paladin 
meanwhile knights do the  promise -> contract -> vow -> oath

"Then, this is where we'll make our base," Midoriya said, and then turned to AFO, "We can do that, right?"
The older man gave him this look, before he gave a breathless chuckle and nodded.
"If it's what you desire."
"...A place to sleep sounds nice," Midoriya said.
AFO stared, the sunken cheeks, the bags under his eyes and nodded. From the start to now, he's certain that his Ruler had gotten even thinner. His inadequacy stared him back in his face, but AFO was nothing but professional.
"Then it shall be done."
If fear could feed the stomach, Midoriya and hunger would have been strangers.

"If you have sex with him, he'll probably recover."
Midoriya choked on his soup, coughing wildly and gracefully accepting the cup of water Sakamata passed him. He wiped his mouth, coughing a few more times as he looked at the man.
"What?"
Sakamata glared at Dabi.
"He's 15!" Aizawa snapped back.
"Yeah, and if he doesn't get his shit together, we all die," Dabi shot back. "What's it going to be, Dear Ruler?"
Midoriya raised his hands in the air, stopping the words there. "Go back a few steps. Please explain this to me first. What's going on?"
"Rulers can bestow [blessings] on their knights," Dabi said, waving his hand lazily in the air. "You know that, right?"
Midoriya nodded. It's how Yagi could enter [All Might] without hurting himself anymore. It was how Aizawa's cancel could expand beyond what he could see. He knew.
"Yeah, but the effects of your blessing will get stronger the more you like your knight," the man said, "If you really want to save that boy of yours, then you should just roll over and spread your legs-"
In an instant, Kan had him imprisoned agaist his chair and Hawks had a feather to his neck.
"Oooh," Dabi looked between the two of them, a little out of breath but otherwise unbothered, "Touchy."
Midoriya stood up, the chair screeching behind him and gave his bowl of soup to Gang Orca. He ran out of the room, and made it to the door when Aizawa stood before him.
"Midoriya-sama, it's not-"
"I can help him!" Midoriya snapped back. "There was another way to help him-"
"There's no garuntee that it will work either!" Aizawa yelled back, "[Blessings] are fickle! Their effectiveness isn't a certainty. When [Blessings] backfire, they become [Curses]! It's not-"
Midoriya's magic, the weight of his [authority] thickened in the air, as it crackled as he took a step back. 
Indeed, the only sense that Midoriya felt anything at all came from his magic, but his expression was carefully blank.
"But I could do something. Right now. I could help."
"Midoriya..."
"Get out of my way."
The tinge of a [command] shimmered under his words. 
And looking as though he was regretting every moment of this, Aizawa stepped to the side and Midoriya ran past him. 
"If you think that keeping things from him is for his benefit," Dabi said, tilting his head to the side, "You're actually doing him a disservice. But I guess it feels better to keep someone innocent, hm?" 
"Give me one reason why we shouldn't kill you," Hawks asked, voice cold.
"It's on my chest," Dabi replied and with a gush of air, Hawks had sliced through Vlad King's blood and tore open Dabi's shirt. "Oooh, aggressive. Too bad I'm taken."
And indeed, Midoriya's symbol shined and glowed on his chest, right above his chest.
"That's right," he said, a wide grin on his face, "I'm one of you."
"...When..."
And Dabi's laughter rang in the room. 

-

"It's frustrating," Midoriya said, and Yagi flinched back like someone sucker-punched him, but the young man shook his head. "I'm only an adult when someone needs something done. I'm only an adult when someone needs to take responsibility. But anything else, drinking, sex, or staying up late, and suddenly, I'm a kid again."
"I.. Shounen..."
"...Don't worry about it, Yagi-san," Midoriya sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "I didn't mean to say anything-"
Yagi came up next to him, a hand reaching out to grab his hand. Green eyes widened, and he stared at their conjoined hands. Before any thoughts could form, the blond spoke up.
"I didn't... I'm sorry. That must have been frustrating."
He squeezed once. His words might sound shallow, but the small bit of comfort made Midoriya's heart grow warm. 
"...It's fine," Midoriya said, because it was easier to forgive and forget it than it was to hold onto these feelings. "You guys didn't want a Ruler like me. I know."
"Incorrect," Yagi said, he pulled on Midoriya's hand, a gentle tug that he could have easily broken out of. He turned and pulled him closer so that they were chest-to-chest, and leaned his face in to rub their noses together. "I can't speak for the others, but I assure you," he said, hot breath washing over his lips as piercing blue eyes started to glow. "I could not have wished for a better Ruler. I am truly blessed to have the opportunity to be yours."
And as though to seal it with a kiss, Yagi's lips landed square against his. He pulled back slowly, like he had to fight ever fiber in his body to not surge in and take more.
Midoriya's face flushed, and Yagi kissed his nose, then his forehead. 
He took a step back at that, leaving Midoriya shivering at the absense of his heat. He smiled, endeared beyond words.
"Please excuse me," he said, taking his jacket off and hanging it over Midoriya's shoulders. His hands ran across the lapels, straightening out the folds and creases, and another shudder ran down his Ruler's body when his hand left burning trails on his body, even though the layers of clothing. "It's chilly out here."
"T-then you'd be..." Midoriya's voice trailed off when he caught the expression on his Knight's face. 
With a firm grip on his shoulders, he leaned in and kissed his forehead again.
"In reality, that's a lie. It's just an excuse," he said, running his hand down the empty sleeve and lifting it up to his lips, he made eyecontact, "to see you in my colors."
Midoriya's face colored darkly.
"I have never seen you as a child, my sweet Ruler," Yagi said. "I assure you, from the moment we met, I have only seen you as my Ruler."
He released him and took a step back, as though to give Midoriya the time and space needed to deal with the knowledge in his head. He smiled brightly, enjoying the way Midoriya's face flushed so darkly, and the way his eyes seemed to shine and shimmer.

-

"I... what?"
"I never offered my [Oath] to you," Dabi said, coming up to stand in front of him. "So I'm going to-"
Midoriya rushed forward to press his hands against his lips, stopping him where he was. Summer blue eyes moved from his face to his hands and then back. He arched an eyebrow and Midoriya yelped and yanked his hands back as Dabi licked his lips.
"D-Don't do that," he said.
"Then don't tempt me," his knight replied back. "And normally, I'd invite this kind of attention, but I'm more interested in why you aren't letting give my [Oath]."
"I don't want it," Midoriya blurted out.
There was a brief silence, Dabi's eyes widening and on anyone else, it would have been hurt. He quickly recovered his composure and tilted his head to the side. So Midoriya was certain that he was surprised, more than anything.
"...Why not?"
"...Why would you want to give me your [Oath]?" Midoriya replied back, eyebrows furrowed. "You're not the type to joke about this..."
"That's because I'm not joking about this," Dabi snapped back, and realizing his tone clicked his tongue. Carefully, he returned to his lackdasical attitude and posture, "You get it now? I'm trying to give you my [Oath]."
"And I don't get why."
"Isn't it obvious? There's only one reason why I'd give you my [Oath]-"
"You can be a [Paladin] without taking an [Oath]," Midoriya interupted. "You don't have to-"
"Midoriya-"
"If you make an [Oath], you can't take it back!" the young man yelled back. "If you make an [Oath], you don't have a choice anymore. You're mine forever! I won't... I won't let you go."
"Yeah," Dabi nodded, "I wanna be your forever." He took a step forward, "Don't let me go."
"I don't..." Midoriya hesitated, taking a step back, and stopping when Dabi did. He finally found his words, and he shook his head, "You'll regret this."
Dabi stared at the space between them, how much distance Midoriya claimed between them, and then back up to Midoriya's eyes.
"For as long as the waves rise for the moon, and for as long as the sun sets, for as long as spring thaws winter, and my fire burns-"
His magic thrummed and Midoriya understood what was going on. On both the [Ruler] side and [Knight] side, there was little to no consent. People can just give their word, share their magic, and the other party could do very little about it. It was as frustrating as it was liberating. When Midoriya did it, it felt like liberation. When someone did it to him, it was suffocating.
"No, wait, Dabi-"
"-I swear to burn for you. [This is my Oath to you.]"
A pair of hands caught onto his elbows and yanked him forward.
"Show me, Midoriya," Dabi said, "Forever."
And slanted his lips against his. The magic that came was intoxicating, completely different from the other [Oaths] that he had recieved. It made him almost believe that Dabi wanted this, that Dabi truly and genuinely wanted to share forever with him, whereas everyone else gave their [vows] on a need-basis. The magic swirled around them, sparks of Dabi's summer blue and Midoriya's spring greens dancing around them like fireflies on a hot night. 
Dabi's large hands slid from his shoulders, one going to the back of his head and the other around his waist. He sucked on Midoriya's bottom lip until his Ruler's jaw relaxed, and then he forced his tongue in. Depsite how he always carried himself, his tongue moved eagerly into his mouth, lapping up and swallowing down any excess saliva. He tilted his head harder, teeth clanking against his but it wasn't enough of a detterant as Dabi pushed in harder, as though to devour his Ruler. 
Midoriya's hands came to his chest, at first to push him away but now he was just holding on. His lungs started to burn for oxygen and his knees started to buckle. He gave a quiet whimper and Dabi finally pulled away.
His pupils were dialated, and his chest heaved. Blue eyes stared at Midoriya with a frightening amount of focus, as though he wanted to commit this moment to his mind. Midoriya coughed, trying to catch his breath. His face burned, and his body felt exhausted. Shyly, he looked up at Dabi, the way he was staring at him, and quickly turned away. 
"T-That's it, right?" he asked, pushing weakly against Dabi's chest.
"Hm... If you're asking," he said, voice so low that it felt like a low growl, "if that's enough for me, then no. It's not enough."
His voice rang all the way down his spine. Midoriya squeezed his thighs together, feeling far too exposed. 
"But if you want to leave, let me walk you back," he said. Large hands came up to his face and he leaned their foreheads together, "just for tonight. Please. Let me watch over you while you rest."
Midoriya trembled under his gentle touch and his quiet voice.
"I... I can't..."
His knees gave out, but before he could be embaressed about it, Dabi swept him up into his arms.
"Forever," he said quietly, "doesn't seem so long."
Midoriya covered his face with his hands. 
"Please shut up."
Dabi chuckled, the sound echoing from his chest and against Midoriya. The young man whined, feeling all of the blood in his body rush to two opposing areas.
"Keep it up," he said, "and I won't be gentle."
"That's probably better," his Ruler sighed back.
Dabi's steps stopped. "You really think that?"
"That way, I won't expect anything," the young man replied, "Just. Get it done and be done with it."
"...Is that the kind of guy you think I am?"
Eyes widening, he realized how his words must have sounded. He covered his mouth, like he couldn't believe that he said it. And wondered how he always ended up with his foot in his mouth. He inwardly groaned, and prepared to apologize-
"You're not wrong. Before, I would have done that."
"Before?"
"Yeah, before I liked you."
"You... what?"
Dabi looked at him and gave a crooked grin. 
"Yeah, before," he slowed down his words, and started walking again. "So, when we do it, when you let me make love to you," and he grinned at the shade of pink Midoriya turned, "I'll take it nice and slow. Open you up on my fingers and mouth, kiss you senseless, touch you till you become putty-"
Midoriya reached a hand over his lips. "Stop that," he said, eyes wide. "I... What are you going to do if I fall in love with you?"
Dabi's eyes turned from their mischevious glint to something far kinder than anything Midoriya had ever seen on him. He hummed and kissed the fingers against his lips. When Midoriya pulled his hand back, Dabi gave a slow smile.
"Well I suppose I'll have to marry you," he said. "Among other things."
"Y-You're ridiculous."
And Dabi's eyes widened before he released a bitter laugh, like he couldn't really believe it either.
"It is, isn't it?" he asked.
They were quiet for the rest of the walk. With Dabi's heartbeat so steady against his ear, Midoriya fell into a lull of quiet.

-

"...You accepted his [Oath]?"
Midoriya gave a slow sigh. Was this really how they were going to start the morning?
"Dabi?" Hawks asked, looking three steps from entering hysterics, "You accepted Dabi's [Oath]?"
He thought they would be more happy about this. This was practically a garuntee that Dabi wouldn't turn against him, after all. Knights under [Oath] cannot directly or indirectly kill their Ruler, among other things.
"Yes," Midoriya nodded, "He was persuasive."
"I've been trying to get you to accept my [Oath]!" the blond snapped back. He covered his face. "You said you didn't want anyone's [Oath]."

-

"Unless you set the hierarchy," Aizawa said, "It's in the order of the [Oath] you accept."
"...Hierarchy," Midoriya repeated.
"Yeah, obviously, Paladins outrank Knights. But of both, you can rank them."
"Obviously," Midoriya parroted, breathless.
"Told you to be careful."
"I thought you meant..." Midoriya placed his head in his hands. "How do I do this?"
"You can change it up everyday," Hawks called from the side, "Keep us on our toes."
"That... sounds coutnerintuitive."
"Make it whoever you want to keep your bed warm that night," Dabi said, a grin on his face.
"Just make it me," Twice said, pointing at himself. "Ta-da, no more problems!"
"

"Todoroki's are like... bred for hunting," Twice said, callous as always, "but what about you, Izuku? How did you get involved in this?"
Midoriya stared forward.
"You know the Aldera Incident?"
"Oh, the gate that suddenly opened inside of a school, right?" Natsuo asked, and then slowly paused. The other two in their group stopped as well, turning to just stare at him. "You don't mean..."
Midoriya nodded, "I was one of the 22 survivors. At that time, I awoken."
"Oh damn," Twice whistled, "You were... elementary school?"
He shook his head, "Middle school. Getting ready to graduate. I can... I can still remember the lecture that my teacher was giving me when we heard the commotion."
There was a common belief that the way a Hunter awakens would determine the kind of hunter they would become. If that was true, than Natsuo's heart ached at the fact that Midoriya awokened as a supporter. 
A hand came to grab his. He stared, where Midoriya's kind eyes looked back at him.
"It was a long time ago," he said, voice as gentle as a spring breeze. "I'm okay." He squeezed Natsuo's hand again. "You don't have to look so sad."
He squeezed back.
"Midoriya, you have two hands," Twice pointed out, "so hold my hand too."
And Natsuo really wished that Twice would learn how to read the mood. Instead, Touya stepped forward to grab Midoriya's free hand. He interlaced their fingers and waved it in front of Twice.
"Oooh, too slow," he said, and in Natsuo's humnle opinion, not smug enough.

-

"I mean all we ever do is dungeon-crawl and shop for things so we can dungeon-crawl," Natsuo pouted. "Let's change things up and do something else for once."
He made eye-contact with his brother.
"...Team-building," his brother said. Which was awful but he supposed he shouldn't expect his lost-in-a-gate-for-five-year brother to have the best social ettiquite.
But Midoriya was pale. Everything on his face screamed that he didn't want to do this. The sight of it made Natsuo's heart squeeze painfully, but he didn't want to back down just yet.
"There's... a mountain that we used to climb up when we were younger. I thought it might be nice to go there again, now that we're all adults and Touya isn't in a Gate."
"Should... I really be there?" Midoriya asked quietly. His fingers trembled around his cup of ice water. "If... It's a old family memory."
Natsuo didn't understand how Midoriya was so scared of things like this but not even flinch when a high orc is swinging an axe at his head. 
"...Yeah," Natsuo said, "It'd make me really happy if you came too."
And Midoriya just looked at him, then Touya, and then to the table.
"You don't have to come if you don't want to," Touya spoke up, his tone just a little louder than usual.
"But it'd make us really happy if you did."
"...Okay," Midoriya said quietly. "But... no matter what happens, we're still a party?"
"Of course!" Natsuo didn't hesitate.
"Yeah," but Touya was a bit softer in his answer.
Midoriya chewed and gnawed on his lip but ultimately nodded his head.
"O-Okay," he said. "I'll... go."

-

"Yep. You fill out this bad boy," he said, waving a piece of paper at them, "and you can declare financial independence."
"...I feel like there's a lot of missing parts to this," Natsuo said, taking the piece of paper and reading over it with Midoriya. "Just this? It doesn't even ask for a list of expenses."
Hawks laughed at that, "It's just a formality."
"...A formality?" Midoriya parroted.
"Yep," the blond nodded, "What wouldn't Japan do for the one and only S-Rank Supporter in the world? They're already walking on thin ice." 
"They are?" Midoriya tilted his head.
"You've gotten a few, right? Offers to go to another country."
The young man nodded, and Natsuo felt sick to the bone.
"Japan doesn't want to give you a reason to leave. If there is something that we can give you, they'll give it."
"Because I'm the only S-Class Supporter?"
"Because you are the Best," the blond corrected. "But wherever you go, you will be treated like a king. This stuff? Piece of cake. You want something? You best believe that they're going to try to make it happen for you."
"...Is that why you're here? So they know what I want?"
The blond stilled. He blinked and slowly turned to Midoriya, who tilted his head at him.
"It'll make it more convienent for me," he said, and he tilted his head to the side, "but won't it be hard for you?"
And between one blink and the other, he relaxed.
"I'm okay," he said, "And it's to my best interest that you like me too."
"I'll support you regardless of how I feel about you," Midoriya replied back, professional and curt.
"I know you will," Hawks grinned back, and when he saw the confusion in the supporter's face, elaborated, "but isn't it obvious that I want to be liked by the person I like?"
Natsuo made this strangled sound, but all Hawks cared about was the way Midoriya's cheeks darkened.
