"I'm quirkless," Midoriya replied, waving his hand. 
"You don't want to change that?"
The young man laughed back, a sounds bright and small like Christmas lights on in the dead of the night. 
"No way," he said, "I don't want to be invincible."


## shitty soul eater au: "Hand in Hand"? "Clasped Hand"

>> conductors + weapons & their resonance 
>> i wanted a verse where there was reckless and almost aggressive hand-holding

- dabi (among others) joins because he likes how it feels to have a conductor. 
- Midoriya has the hilt/handle of a blade, just the hilt actually, as though the blade had been broken off. idk if it's afo or ofa. 


### dabi on the sofa

Hawks laughed, his hand grabbing Midoriya's wrist as he tugged him to the kitchen. As soon as Dabi was out of sight, he pushed his Conductor against the wall and looked down at him.

"I can explain," Midoriya quickly explained, waving his hands in front of himself.

The blond took a deep breath in and then nodded, "Alright. Get to it."

"He's lost. And hungry."

"Midoriya, he's not some stray dog. You can't just-"

"And he has a lead on the Jack the Ripper case-"

"-so he's just been living here? With you?"

The young man nodded again, and when he opened his mouth to say something, another voice spoke up.

"You know, just because you move to a different room, doesn't mean that I suddenly can't hear you."

Hawks jolted when someone kicked him to the side. His wings fluttered, keeping him upright, and Dabi yawned as he stood in front of Midoriya.

"Let's be civil," he said, a sharp smile on his face as he stared down the man in front of him. "Wouldn't want someone getting hurt, would we?"

And to both of their shock, Midoriya's hand came to grab Dabi's. The taller man turned a bit, just twisting his chest to look at the young man, and his shoulder relaxed minutely when his gaze met Midoriya's. 

"Dabi?" Midoriya asked quietly, and something cold gripped Hawks' chest as Dabi released a breath and took a step back. 

Standing next to Midoriya, he adjusted the grip of his hand to interlock his fingers with Midoriya's instead.

"You know I wouldn't do that to you," he said, "Just messing around."

"Didn't really sound like it to me."

And Dabi, a Wanted Criminal in several countries and on several hit-lists, frowned back and replied, "...I'll make it up to you. You want that pasta for dinner again?"

"You can't just bribe me with food," Midoriya spluttered back.

"Is that a no?"

The young man sucked his cheeks in and then quietly said, "With the bacon bits?" 

Dabi nodded, his smile turning excessively warm.

"No problem."

With another long stare, the conductor relented. 

"Okay," he said, "if you make enough for three."

Dabi's shoulder tensed, and Midoriya's hand squeezed his.

"Slave-driver," he muttered back. "Three, right? Fine." He stared at Midoriya, at Hawks' Conductor for another minute before he took a deep breath through his nose. Releasing his hand, he ruffled Midoriya's hair with his other hand and walked into the kitchen, presumably to start dinner.

And Hawks turned his attention back to Midoriya, hoping for an answer and a way. 

"His pastas are really good," Midoriya said quietly, his eyes bright, "Really creamy."

And there were a lot of problems with this. Starting with the fact that Midoriya had been housing some criminal for some, unknown amount of time, to the fact that there was someone cohabitating with his Conductor when he had always been shown the door when it hit ten pm on the dot. 

"I can make pasta too," Hawks lied through his teeth. And with a hand grabbing his, he shook his head. There was something more important than that. Something a lot more important. "Have you resonated with him?"

Midoriya stared at him for a moment and slowly nodded.

"Yeah."

Hawks remembered it. A deliberating amount of pain that almost knocked him out of flight, and he had to rest against a building until he could get that sensation, of his heart pumping liquid pain throughout his body. All the while, he could see the small smile Midoriya gave to the ground, and the words of Command Center echoed in his head.

["Be careful."]

But in front of him, Midoriya looked like he was fine. Obviously he was fine, since Hawks wasn't doubled over in pain.

He took a step closer, and placed a hand against his waist, right above his hip bone and felt him stiffen.

"...It hurt, didn't it?"

"Dabi got me out of there."

Which, in Midoriya's words, meant that Dabi was the cause of that flaring pain. He was the cause and the reason for the pain, but due to reasons, they teamed up and haven't un-teamed since. 

Hawks stared at him and then dropped his hands. Taking a step back, and fighting the full-body jerk to remain next to his conductor.

"Alright," he said, "Well, officially, I'm here to let you know that the Jack the Ripper case has moved up in priorities. I'm here to help."

"What a relief," Midoriya replied, a smile on his face, "Then, I guess we'll get this done sooner."

"Yeah, your teachers will be informed and notified." Hawks explained. "It could be better circumstances, but I'm glad to work with you again."

"Sounds like a load of bullshit to me," Dabi said, approaching them with a sleazy grin befitting of all the scars on his "since you only come when he need to use him, right?"

"Dabi-"

"But you know, when he has nightmares and owwies, the person who's there for him is the person that hurt him," Dabi said, eyes shining as he bit the words out. Somehow, the tone of his voice and the expression he made didn't fit at all, like two separate people were being presented, but all Hawks could feel was a rising fury from the words. "But I'm the bad guy. Funny, right?"

"Dabi!" Midoriya stood between Hawks and him, but before he could say anything, Dabi raised his hands, as though in surrender.

"Right, right," he said, "Play nice with the other weapons, no matter how useless they really are."

Midoriya's hand came and grabbed his. He stepped forward, and craned his neck up.

"You don't have to come," he explained. "If you don't want to."

"...What's the matter?" he bit back, "Regretting saving me?"

And Midoriya who shook his head and replied, "No. But I can smell something burning."

The anger was replaced with something else and with one last nasty glare, he turned around to wander back into the kitchen. Green eyes turned to Hawks, and he smiled.

"Rough around the edges," Midoriya said, "But I don't think he's a bad person."

"Really?"

"Yeah, maybe a little lost, but he's not a bad person."

And Hawks would hate to know Midoriya's definition of a bad person. He really, really would.

"Alright," he said, because the only thing he hated more than not being with Midoriya was stressing him out. 

### worth protecting - dabi v endeavor

"He said he wanted to protect something," Midoriya explained.

"And?" Endeavor snapped back, "What does that have to do with anything-"

"So I want to help him."

And half a second right before Endeavor started to scream and yell, Midoriya stood, small but certain, in front of him.

"Because I also have things that I want to protect. And I know you do too."

Endeavor stared at him, "You know what he would do to you to protect that?"

"You'll keep me safe," Midoriya replied, "because I'm valuable as a Conductor."

"I'll keep you safe because there's personal feelings involved," the older man replied, surprising both of them. "However, I would appreciate it if you didn't make my life harder than it needed to be."

Dabi stared at Endeavor like he had never seen this lifeform before.

"...Let's keep moving."

He extended his hand to Midoriya, and the young man took it with a smile on his face. Endeavor, keeping his face forward, couldn't stop the tinge of red coating his ears.



### accepting death - ShigaDeku

"If by my death, the world can become a better place, then I don't think that it's a bad thing."

"...Do you understand what you're saying?" Shigaraki asked, "Wh...What's the point? You-you worked so damn much. You didn't, if anyone, the only person that actually deserves to live in the first place is-"

Deku grabbed his hand.

"If you think that. If you really think that," he squeezed his hand, "Then live a long and happy life, Shigaraki."

Numb, the man stared at him.



## sat

Almost three hundred years from now, people would look back to these moments and call their predessors savages. They were just awful people that murdered relentlessly instead of saving people.

Which was funny because there were plenty of other groups that did the same things as Izuku's, it was just that none of them managed to survive as long as Izuku's did. Of course, what people didn't know was what people didn't know.

### finding a researcher

"P-Please, that's-that's my research! Please!"

Dabi lifted his hand up, he's seen the shit people did "in the name of science" and he wasn't going to put up with it any longer than he had to. Everything in here would be ash, researcher included, and just as he got the fire on his hands, the vent above was kicked out and Izuku fell through.  

Dabi clenched his jaw tightly as the young man rolled and got up just as fast. He looked at them.

"Get away!" the researcher snapped out, "What the hell do you think you're doing?! There's a way to turn people back! I am on a breakthrough-"

"People don't turn if you kill what bit them," Izuku spoke sharply. He stared at him and then back at the files, "but if they die after being bit, it doesn't matter."

Dabi felt his arm throb.

"I... Truly?"

Izuku turned to the cage where a mutant, the one similar to the ones that they had been hunting down, laid on the ground. Leg chained to the bar, Izuku stared at it for a moment longer before he turned around.

"What have you been researching?"

Dabi closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could already imagine how much shit he was going to get from Stain and the others about this.

"B-Behavioral things," the man replied, "We, well, uh, me now. I-I-I've been running some tests on it. Getting samples of its hair and blood and ch-checking the biological state of it. B-but there aren't a lot of-of readily available samples and we have to-to be careful not to kill the one we have so-"

Izuku stared at the sample for another moment.

"They're empathic, and capable of emotions like rage and joy."

"I... what?"

The young man turned around.

"There's about 38 of these guys circling around this lab," Izuku said, "Or at least, we killed 38 of the ones that were circling this lab."

"I... What?"

"They're probably here because they knew that one of their own is here-"

"-But that's preposterous? Some monsters? Being able to emote like-like-"

And Izuku sighed, a deep breath through his nose that told Dabi that he was done talking for the week, and Dabi turned to take his anger out on the guy. Quickly and efficiently. Bastard didn't even deserve to look at Izuku. And Dabi, who had to wait an entire year before he got to hear that voice, hated how this guy heard it after a few seconds.

The fire crackled, a flash of blue that illuminated the entire room and the researcher backed up. All four of his arms came to cover his head, and Dabi's lips curled into a smile. Like his arms would make a difference under the might of Dabi's flames.

"Th-there's more! Feeding them human meat will make them more human! You can tell how much they had evolved by how humanoid they become!"

Izuku and Dabi paused.

"...You fed it your friends?"

"It was-was the pursuit of knowledge! What would you understand about that!?"

Dabi took a step to stand between the two. He looked to Izuku and spoke frankly.

"Can I torch him?" he asked, and for good measure added, "Please?"

"D-Don't touch those!" the researcher screeched back, as Izuku looked through some of the data.

"Izuku, perimeter is cleared and secured," the walkie attached to Dabi and Izuku's belt sounded loudly.

Dabi's hand came to his walkie, an he stared at Izuku. When the young man continued to look through files, he gave a sigh and popped it off his belt. 

"Copy. Standby."

Izuku, to his shock, took his walkie off, "Chisaki. Respond."

"Go ahead, Izuku."

"Go to the science prep room and grab the gray journal from the third drawer in the file cabinet next to the window. Bring a camera. Come out to where I am."

"Understood."

"Come in a car," Izuku continued. "Standby, give me four snipers and the rest of you go help clear out the road."

"Roger!"

"Copy that."

Izuku looked back at the research notes and then back to the researcher. He lifted a packet of paper and turned to him.

"This is signed by Mitsubara," he said. "Where is he?"

--> lead to rody's dad? Engineer? of the scientist group that were trying to figure shit out? (use apoc no toride lady/dude?) 

### soul

"Around the time Lala was born," the man said, "I got moved to the Japan Branch."


He gave a hoarse laugh. "If only we never left Otheon. I... I think my kids would have had an easier life."



## Solo Lvl

"So what, are you... the President? Prime Minister? Mayor?" Natsuo asked.

"King, Emperor," Dabi continued to list from where he was leisurely eating popcorn on the couch. He gave an unrepentant grin when Natsuo narrowed his eyes at him. "So I guess we're consorts."

Midoriya frowned, "I'm a supporter."

"No, I mean," Natsuo motioned to the City Plans, "Since you're like.. the owner of Mustafuyu. And pretty much, people are treating you with more respect than they would Japan Delegates."

Midoriya looked at the papers in front of him.

"...I'm a Supporter," he repeated. "I protect people."

And maybe anyone else, it would have been some lofty words from a kid that had no idea what to do or how to run a small country. But this was Midoriya Izuku, who was under scrutiny of the entire world, the person that redefined the concept of [Supporters], and Natsuo still felt his heart skip a beat when he saw him smile. 

Touya looked at him, and swallowed before he spoke. 

"Izuku," he said, "I love you."

The frank statement had Natsuo's cheeks burning, but Midoriya's face flushed faster than wildfire.

"What's important to you is important to me," he continued, and smiled. 

Damn, Natsuo thought. He was so damn cool.
