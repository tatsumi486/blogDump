### returning a gift

Midoriya understood. If he wasn't careful, he was going to lose everything to this. His life, his future, his aspirations, everything. In that sense, wasn't it better to ruin things for himself? Then, it would be his own dumb decisions that caused this, instead of someone else making this decision for him. 
Thinking that, his eyes found Dabi's. 
Tilting his head, he gave him a small smile. 
"It looks like... it'll be storming for a whi. I think..." he looked up and gav ehim a small smile, could Dabi tell how nervous he was? Probably, since Dabi was observant. But he doubted that the man cared, and that's what Midoriya was banking on, "there's a few things we could do to pass the time?"
Because if he had to lose it, it should be on his terms. 

-

Hah. Noob. Needless to say, Spinner trashed Shigaraki in Smash, all 14 times they fought. 

-

In that second, a knife came into the temple of the man, and Midoriya bodily shoved Spinner behind him. Eyes bright like they were electrificed, met his, and Spinner's eyes fell to the body on the ground.
Two hands grabbed his head and force him to face Midoriya and his bright eyes.
"It's not your fault," he said. "Spinner. Iguchi, it's not your fault. Take a deep breath with me. It's hard. I know." 
But at the time, all Spinner could think about was how warm Midoriya's hands were. 
Was a person supposed to be this warm? He didn't know. Coming from a family of lizard-quirks, they were really similar to most cold-blooded reptiles, so much so that many would never consider them humans to begin with. 
"Iguchi," Midoriya said, "This is my fault. This isn't yours. I killed that man. You were just a bystander. You didn't do anything."
But that was it. Midoriya wouldn't know, since Spinner never told him and since he didn't have a quirk that made him look different from everyone else but that was the problem. The fulcrum of the issue, and it was him. It was Spinner. It was people like Spinner.
People who stood there and let things happen in front of them, and then pretended that they didn't see it and that it wasn't their fault and that they couldn't do anything.
And when Dabi's dismissive gaze looked down at him, Spinner wasn't afraid or scared for once He understood why Dabi looked at him like that.
"We needed to leave like twenty minutes ago," Dabi reported, and Midoriya pulled his hands to grab and squeeze Spinner's hands. 
"Deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth," he instructed the older man, maintaining steady eyecontact with him like Dabi never spoke. "Count backwards from 21 by 3's." 
Spinner jerked his head, hoped that it looked like he was nodding, and Midoriya smiled back. Standing up, he turned to Dabi and pulled a disposable camera out of his hoodie pocket.
"There's four left," Midoriya said. "When there's just two left, they'll try to run-"
"Get to it."
"...No witnesses," he said, and the shakes came right back to Spinner. "Let's finish this job."
Dabi's grin widened like this was all he was waiting for, and looking more monster than human, he turned around. 
"Roger," he said, and walked out. 
Midoriya watched him go before he sighed. He walked back around to pull the blade out of the man's head, and Spinner's gut churned at the sound it made and he suddenly realized that it was his pen. Spinner had been so convinced that it had to be a weapon, but he had neglected to think that anything could be a weapon. 
In a game that he played, there was a lot of jokes and trash talking in the chartroom, that mocked a character for fighting with a serving spoon. And now, he felt like he was experiencing the world for the first time, and was left with an dizzying amount of vertigo.
As it turned out, he was the coward that he hated the most.

"This time," Shigaraki said, waving the controllers at him, "for certain."
Spinner stared at him and laughed. "Oh man," he said, "I haven't played in so long. Ready for your next beatdown."
Shigaraki bared his teeth at him. "Bring it on."
Even losing, Spinner felt good. The button mashing felt good. Watching someone fall to their death again, even if it was him, felt great. 
Maybe it was because it was 2-D. He knew, they weren't real. They would come back. It wasn't real. So it was okay.
Surprisingly, Spinner had a hard time forgetting his first kill. 

### apoc

"...Do you sleep?" Eraserhead asked, arms crossed over his chest as he leaned against the doorframe.  
Someone hasn't been sleeping? And then, thinking about it, he supposed that it made sense. Even Deku resisted sleeping until he felt like there was no choice but to close his eyes and rest. If he was so bone-weary exhausted, after all, he wouldn't be able to dream.
But he knew. The headaches were atrocious. He got bloody noses that soaked the front of his mask and kept it slathered against his face wuntil he returned to a plaace he could get it off. Sometimes, he woke up, learning that he soaked his blanket, and he decided that it was just better not to sleep with anything and sleep in the bathroom tub where it would at least be easy to clean up. 
He couldn't stomach the thought that someone else would be in that much pain next to him. 
What could he do for them? 
Deku turned to Eraserhead, and the man straightened. He wondered if the man was tired, so bone-weary exhausted. Did he also pray that he didn't dream? Did he count his hours so that he could plan the two hours he could close his eyes before he got up and did something again? That was an awful way to live, Deku would know. 
When? Deku wanted to scream. When did peopple like Eraserhead, who were just suffering for no reason and continously suffering on, get to take a break? His heart twisted in his chest, that red-hot anger bubbling up and tightening his throat, because it wasn't fair. He couldn't fathom what Eraserhead had gone through, and then, on top of that, he still can't take a fucking break?
"Helmet?"
Deku turned around. There had to be something that he could do to help him. Anything at all. There had to be something even he could do, so that the others, including Eraserhead, could catch a breath. 

-

And then Ingenium was in front of him.
"Wait, stop!"
Deku jerked, but stopped where he stood. The older man, bent over his knees, gasped for breath and pointed behind him.
"We need to take a break. We can't just keep going like this."
Deku looked at them and then checked the position of the sun. He could send them back right now, but that wouldn't garuntee that they would get there in time. It would be better for them to sit down and have a break. He looked down to his left, it wasn't much, but his safe-house was around the area. He motioned for them to folow him. 
When they were all situated, he turned back to the door, and Dabi grabbed his wrist. 
"Where are you going?" he asked. 
Deku looked at their hands. It had been a long time since someone had touched him without the intention of hurting him. It was a fascinating feeling. Had people always been warm? In a memory as far away as it was foggy, he wondered if this was a constant thing.
