### way back home
"S-sorry," Twice said, as Midoriya came to help him pick up the shards of glass on the ground.
"It's okay," Midoriya said. 
"I just... I just keep fucking up."
"No one starts perfectly."
"But I just... I keep messing up. I just..."
Midoriya's hand came to Twice's.
"Do you want to stop?"
Twice's eyes met Midoriya's. A steely gray, indestructable like steel, but malleble with enough stress.
"...No."
Midoriya grinned back.
"I'll be here."
The blond leaned forward, pressing their foreheads together for a moment. He took a deep breath and nodded. Getting up and taking the trash bag from Midoriya, he gave a wide grin.
"Don't you worry, Midoriya! I'm not out for the count yet! You ain't seen nothing yet! Jin's just getting started!"

-

"Midoriya!"
Midoriya turned around, looking for the person who was calling him, when a motorcycle pulled up next to him. Placing a foot on the ground, the motorcyclist pulled his helmet off. 
"Tamaki-senpai!"
"Where are you going?" the man asked.
"I'm heading to the station," Midoriya replied back. "I'm meeting up with some classmates for our assignment."
Tamaki pulled a spare helmet out of his back compartment.
"I'll give you a ride," he said, "Get on."
"Eh? No, it's okay, I-"
"C'mon," Tamaki said, a confident grin on his face as he pulled his helmet on, "I haven't spent any time with you in a while."
Yes, Midoriya thought. That was the point.
Obediantly, however, he got on. Tamaki's hands grabbed his and pulled them around his waist. As a result, Midoriya ended up with his chest right against Tamaki's back. He felt a little bad, since he could see how red Tamaki's neck was getting. It must have been really hot.

-

"Midoriya, are you free Thusday night?" 
Midoriya, after handing the helmet back to Tamaki, took a moment to think about it.
"I... should be."
"Do you..." Tamaki's face started to turn an alarming shade of red as he looked down, "Do you wanna get dinner with me?"
Green eyes widened, and he stared back.
"I... huh?"
"Give me an answer by tonight," Tamaki said, hurridely putting his helmet on. He stopped to stare at Midoriya again. "And, for the love of god, be safe."
"I-I will," Midoriya said. And he took a step towards Tamaki, "You too. Drive safely."


### rotting flower
Midoriya woke up, head throbbing as he sat up.
"Are you alright?" 
He stopped cold, and turned his head. In a brief moment of absolute, heart-stopping, shock, his pain faded for a split-second to see and understand that he was naked underneath a thin sheet and the giant, boulder of a muscleman was also naked, crouched on the bed Midoriya was on. Naked. And huge. From the way that Midoriya had to crane his head to look up at him, to the fact that he was just huge. Eveyr bit of him. Even parts that Midoriya didn't mean to look at. Just.
Who the fuck was this? Why was he here? In his bed?
As the questions started to form, the headache came back in full swing. Vertigo swung him like he was on a rollarcoaster ride, and he covered his mouth. 
"G-Get out..."
"Pardon? I didn't hear-"
"I said, get out!"
And then, finally, Midoriya was alone to pass out promptly.

-

Wheezing between breaths, feeling as though he couldn't get enough air into his lungs even as his ribcage continously expanded and contracted, Midoriya suddenly jerked to the side as another wave of nausea hit him. In seconds, he was puking again, but the clawing sensation of stomach bile burned all the way up and out.
"Do you want to live?"
What kind of question was that, of course he did! He didn't want to die now. Not like this. 
"I can save you, if you forfeit your life?"
Making a person think when their head felt like it was splitting apart was so goddamn rude. 
"That's not how you hsould be talking to someone who's trying to help you at all."

-

There was one way to deal with this. One way. It was to pretend that the outside world wasn't real. That this wasn't real. 
And then four and a half days passed and reality sunk in when a frantic knock came at the door.
"My Lord? Are you alright?"
And Midoriya Izuku, lost in his questions, finally allowed someone in. Might have also been because he felt so hungry his hands were trembling.
"My Lord, it is your Flower All Might," the large man introduced himself as he came into the room with a tray. He placed it on one of the tables to the side, and kneeled a foot in front of the bed Midoriya was on. "I greet the Empire's Flower," he said with a hand over his heart. 
Midoriya winced because... really? The Empire's Flower? Him? To call him a flower was a push, he was more like a weed. And the men he spend his time with, he wouldn't call them flowers either. More like rocks. Or rather, boulders. In All Might's case, a mountain.
"It's a term of endearment."
Midoriya gave a high-pitch gasp and he whipped over to where AFO smiled amiably at him. He always forget that, if he wasn't careful, this man could just read his thoughts. It was as annoying as it sounded, even if it had its uses at times.
"...I don't feel very Endeared," he said.
"If you would allow me," All Might spoke up, "I can do something about that."
