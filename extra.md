The problem with getting hurt was that it made it easier to get hurt. Which was funny and sounded totally obvious. But Deku wasn't very bright.
For people like him, who only had hard work (and even then, that wasn't much) 

-

"...Need some help?"
He said it, and it sounded so friendly. Deku felt his heart crack a little. Did he look so pitiful that Ingenium, who clearly wasn't better yet, felt like he should help? 
Deku felt ashamed. The man deserved a break, but couldn't even get that, because he was worrying about Deku. He needed to get his shit together.
His arm dropped from where he was cradling it.
"...Helmet-san?"
Oh, not him. Deku looked back forward. He couldn't wait to meet this Helmet, who was so great that Ingenium would drag his body and face these nightmare-like situations again. Was it inspiring? To look out and see someone that made his fears shrink and courage grow. 
Deku understood, because for him, Ingenium brought the same feelings forward for himself.
He looked forward. He needed to work harder. There was no excuse for laziness.

"So, what's your name?"
Aizawa froze, his jaw sliding open as he stared at the curious look on Mina's face. 
"No one asked?" he heard Chisaki hiss out, his voice inching on hysteric. "No one ever fucking asked?"
But there was no answer from Helmet, who paused for a bit, and then must have thought that it was a waste of time, because he walked by her instead. And then he did something he never did before. He stopped in his steps, four feet away from the confused and a little hurt Mina, and then walked right back. Right when they thought that there might be an answer, he walked by her again and straight for the rental office.
"Right," Chisaki sighed, "that makes more sense."
And Aizawa would have never thought he would have so much in common with a man like him.

"So, what's your name?"
Deku paused. 
Name?
Like, a designation? 
He stared at her for a moment, blinked twice. He looked down. 
He had one. He knew he had one. A woman, who lived as fleeting as the petals on a flower, said to it to him. She was someone that defined home to him, from the way she wiped her hands on her apron before hugging him to the way she beamed at him- that her favorite hero had come to her rescue-
He felt nauseous. What was her name? Their relation was something sacred to him. 
His steps took him forward, his stomach twisting in his chest. He had been so scared but now he couldn't remember what scared him so badly? The lingering fear draped over his back, squeezing him tightly.
