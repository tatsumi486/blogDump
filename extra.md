"You want to be free, right?" Midoriya asked, eyes gentle. "It's alright. I don't blame you."
He looked at the assailant, he looked young.
Death by stabbing. It wasn't the worst way to go, and all things considered, this was probably bettter. 
"Get out of here quickly," he said. "Or else you will face a life worse than death."
"Why... Why are you letting me go?"
"When we're hurt, we hurt others. It's alright. I don't blame you. So run away and forget all of this.

### apoc
"It's a monster that can take the face of those that its eaten before," Deku said. "Be careful."
"And you know this because..."
Shigaraki shot Kirishima a harsh look. Wasn't it obvious why he knew this?
"From the start to now, there has been two monsters that I failed to kill," Deku said, staring at the map in front of him with an uncanny amount of focus. "That one was one of them. No matter how many times I killed them, there are always more."
"...That's disturbing. Are they clones?"
"Clones usually dissipate when they're killed," Deku replied back, shaking his head, "but those bodies remain long enough that we can burn them into nothing."

"I'm telling you to stay down," Natsuo said, hands on his shoulder and pushing the man back onto the bed. With fresh cotton balls, he got to work on the nasty cut running along Deku's hairline. "Relax for a few seconds, okay? Let me get the bleeding to stop."
The young man managed a small smile, and he sat back just a little bit.
"Sorry," he said.
"Yeah, yeah," Natsuo sighed, the frustrations leaaving him with his breath. "Just stay still for a moment," he said. "Anything else hurt?"
The young man shook his head.
"Don't lie to me," he said.
"Hey, the last group's back!" the shout came from outside. Deku jerked up, stopping only when Natsuo's hands dropped on his shoulder.
"I swear to god, Deku," he warned. "One sec," he turned around, probably to tell whoever was outside to call in the Group Leader for the group that just returned. 
Instead, however, Iida Tenya was there. "Todoroki-sensei!" he called out to Natsuo, "My brother-!"
Natsuo's expression tightened, "I'll be right there," he said. "Help Deku's-"
Deku was on his feet and out the door, just barely remembering to grab bat as he rushed out the door. Natsuo groaned, only imagining that the young man's stitches would be torn again, but rushed to go. 

-

It had been a while since it was just a mess.
Deku's steps were quiet, yet everything slowly fell to an eerie silence as he made his way into the room. Bandages a stark white against his bruising skin, he walked in briskly. His eyes took in the sight of Miruko, laying on her back as sweat perpirated on her face before she was quickly wheeled away by Tabe and Hojo. 
His eyes crossed the room. Ryuku, despite supporting major wounds on her arm, rushed in with Jiro in her arms. Uraraka settled in a chair while Shigaraki thrust a wastebasket into her arms. Shouto passing out hot towels, and Midnight, who was trying to stauch the bleeding from Sakamata. Awase and Aoyama rushing with arms filled with bloodied blankets out the door. Dabi and Hakamata, carefully supported Compress in, expressions tight and bodies in varying state of injury. Menawhile Fatgum and Ojiro rushed back in, fresh linen in their arms as they carefully took instruction from Present Mic on where to go. Makoto, carefully instructing people where to set supplies and the likes to several copies of Twice, and still it didn't feel like they had enough hands. 
A field hospital, Deku suddenly realized.
The common longue on the first floor felt like a field hospital. 
Deku, who led this expedition, who stood up and said that this was something he wanted to do, that picked and pulled people out to take out that awful thing that stood eye-to-eye with a tower, had caused this. Even though this had been what he always done, the victory had come too close.
"Deku," Nighteye was in front of him, eyes bright as he took in his features, "Let's get you looked at." 
Deku was a mess. He knew even without saying anything. He had gotten tossed out of the air twice and his arm was one punch from literally falling off. He shook his head, and instead looked around. that burning question was on his lips.
"What happened?" he asked sharply.
Nighteye stared at him for a long moment, and understanding that Deku wasn't moving until he had answers, sighed quietly.
"When back-up left to support you, they ran into trouble on the way back. You were right, it wasn't just that Collossal Head."
Deku felt heavy, but the fact that the person wh owas reporting wasn't from Back-Up made his heart start to twist. "Casualties?" Deku asked, but his tone didn't change, making it sound more like an order.
"Everyone came back alive except..."
Ingenium stepped forward, and passed the hilt of a broken blade towards Deku.
"Deku," he said quietly. "Stain didn't return with us."
Deku's hands trembled as his eyes widened. The hiltless blade was a staple, and the ripped, red bandanna tied only seemed to cement it.
This was Stain's blade.
He stared for a long time, and he looked up at Ingenium. Maybe it was the pulsing headache, or the fact that his arm was literally hanging on by some strands of muscles. Maybe it was because Deku was still a child, who didn't think that he could still lose people, when it was a normal and accepted part of life. Perhaps it was because he was in over his head, and that he had been in over his head this whole time, but now reality was clapping him in the ears.
"You're lying!"
His voice echoed, and the room fell silent. 
"Deku..."
He covered his eyes. No, no, it wasn't Ingenium's fault. Ingenium probably had came forward to say it for a reason, and Deku knew that no one wanted this and no one could have planned for something so obvious-
"You're not lying, are you?" he asked quietly. He took the blade and held it against his chest.
"Deku, I'm sorry."
Weren't they all?
There was a long moment of silence before Deku got a hold of himelf. He straightened up and looked Ingnieum straight in the eyes. He was not the only person that lost something.
"...I'm glad you're okay," he said, because the living mattered. They were his first priority.

-

"...Chizome."
And an arm-less than he remembered him, Stain appeared in front of him.
"Deku," he turned to him. "My blade."
A laugh bubbled out of him, because there was only one thing he needed to know that this wasn't fake.
He pulled the blade out of his belt, and gave it back.
"Welcome back," he said.
Stain, as exhausted as he looked, still managed to pull his lips up into a wide grin.
"I'm back." 
Deku stared at him for a moment longer, his eyes welling up with tears. He focused forward, and for the moment, felt invincible. 

### sat

Shigaraki had ten fingers.
He didn't use to. Which was funny. Since he always ragged on people for being useless and not pulling their weight, and all of that. but when it really came down to it, he was about as useful as a baby. Consumed a lot of supplies for absolutely nothing in return. As much as he wanted to claim that it wasn't really his fault, since it wasn't like he had the hands to help with, he knew the truth.
He didn't want to live. He didn't want to die. The ultimate state of laziness, where he wouldn't try to survive but he wouldn't actively look for death either. 
Supposedly, at the end of the world, people were supposed to come together and fight. Deadweight were just bodies waiting to die. Shigaraki, who had been a part of three separate groups (and caused the demoition of four), saw this as a certainty. It just wasn't feasible, to think that anyone would be able to do that for anyone. In majority of the places he's seen, even children and eldery were expected to work if they wanted to eat. 
People could not survive on their own. They were weak like that. Confronted with monsters, it became even more apparent how lacking they were. the people that Shigaraki used to think of as invincible fell apart like ash.
The world that Sensei wanted, filled with excitement and The Strong, turned out to be a world where he didn't belong.
Weak, weak, weak. Monsters hung on the horizon and everyone was just weak. Humanity was just biding their time to die. 
And Shigaraki was certain that this was his reality.
Missing seven fingers and half his hand, Shigaraki leaned against the concrete wall. Lost in a residental neighborhood he's never seen before, he watched former civilians and monsters shuffle and crawl towards him. And at that time, he figured he'd die without being anyone. Even if he wanted to fight it, what could he do?
While contemplating nothing, a man in a helmet came down the street. Armed with just a bat, Shigaraki was forced to confront a new reality.

-

Shigaraki yawned. Dreaming abut the past always made him feel even more tired. He scratched the back of his neck, a habit he never broke out of, and shuffled out of his shitty sleeping bag. 
The moon poured in from above, a rare sight after all these days of constant snow. Well, it wasn't like he was going to get anymore sleep. 
The third-floor prep lab was his. It was small, but he preferred it to being cramped in a classroom with some of the others.
To begin with, he didn't have many memories of school. It probably was from a time before Sensei, and honestly, if he didn't remember anything, it was probably because it wasn't worth remembering. 
He made his way to the sink, washed his face, and grabbed his jackets. Even with the heating on, it was still too cold.
Which was funny. He could sleep without this jacket but his gun never left his side. If someone had stopped him three years ago, told him that he would trust weaponry over his quirk, he would have laughed in their face. 
He slid the door open, and his nose immediately crinkled. Someone had guts to come scenting the area around his territory. He crackled his knuckles. With how strung-up everyone had been getting, it was only a matter of time before something gave. A grin twisted onto his face at the thought that he would get to-
His thoughts stopped he heard someone's sharp cry. Without thinking much, he sprinted over.

An omega that smelled like blood would be the omega that Shigaraki couldn't stop staring at. 

### Way Back Home

["this isn't your world"]
Midoriya woke up, tears streaming from his eyes. He sat up, fingers coming up to his eyes and he took a deep breath.
Today too, he was in the wrong place.


"Well, whatever you want, I'm certain you'll get there," Miruko said, certain like the sun.
When Midoriya looked up at her, she grinned back down.
"Look, hard work pays off."
And somehow, being told that after the long hiking journey hit him differently.
His eyes welled with tears. His body was that pleasant kind of tired, where he worked it out just enough, and his heart felt calm. He sniffled as he looked over the horizon.
The world would look the exact same, but they would be incredibly different. The skyline with Miruko was one that he would probably never see again, not in his world where Miruko couldn't...
He looked out.
"Everyone..." his voice cracked, but he kept going, "says that. That I'll get everything that I want."
And his heart felt like it was going to fold in on itself and crumple, like a house made of cards. 
His hands trembled, because success meant goodbye.
These days, no matter how hard he berated himsef for stealing what wasn't his, the words began to rang hollow even in his own ears.

### withering 

"Izuku," Inko laughed, "When have you ever listened to me?" And she said it like she meant to tell him how much she loved him.

-

"But I can't save you."
Aizawa grabbed his shoulders, had his head bowed forward so that Midoriya couldn't even see his face.
"I can't save you."
Midoriya's expression slowly turned to pity as he eyed the Pro-Hero in front of him. It might be mocking, to pity someone as great and fundamentlaly important as Aizawa, but Midoriya couldn't help it. After all, this was something that plagued his mother.
Midoriya raised his hands to gently cup Aizawa's face.
"...It's okay," he said, "I'm glad I met you."
He brought their foreheads together, and Aizawa's hands slipped from his shoulders and around his back.
"I'm sorry," he whispered quietly.
No, no, Midoriya would be the one to say that. Because if Midoriya could turn back time, he wouldn't have changed anything. The moments he shared with Aizawa were treasured. All of them. 
"If we all get reincarnated," Midoriya started slowly, "Don't be stingy about how many pizza toppings we get, okay?" 
"You're insufferable," he replied back, a grin pulling at the corner of his lips.
Aizawa kissed him gently, as though he was already prepared to say goodbye.

-

"I... What is this?"
"Medicine isn't cheap," Aizawa said, "but it helps maintain your current state, right?" 
Midoriya gaped at the thick envelope and he shook his head. 
"I-I can't accept this-"
A large hand grabbd the envelope from the table and thrust it against Midoriya's chest. Aizawa's other hand came around his waist, and with little effort, the older man leaned down to kiss him softly against his lips. 
Midoriya gave a soft whine, as Aizawa's teeth carefully gnawed against his bottom lip and he sucked gently. He pulled back slowly.
"Try a little harder to stay alive. And I'll make it worth your while."
And under his gaze, Midoriya lost all capability to think for himself. 
At Midoriya's speechless gaze, Aizawa chuckled.
"Good boy," he purred out, knowing full well how hot those words made him feel. "C'mon, I'll walk you home."
"You would go out of your way for me? My mom won't like it."
"I need to introduce myself eventually," he said, getting off the couch. He walked to grab a jacket and looked at Midoriya, probably assessing if he could get away with wrapping the younger man in another jacket. 
"Uh, what?"
"I don't want to isolate you from your family," Aizawa replied, "So I might as well introduce myself to my in-law."
"In-law?"
"...Are you sick?" he asked, a crooked grin on his face, "Should I carry you home?"
Midoriya gaped back at him, and  his brain finally kicked back into gear.
"You're ridiculous," he said. 
"Nah," Aizawa chuckled. He threw an old jacket around him, a knowing smile on his face because of course Midoriya reognized the jacket he was wearing the second time they went on that date, and leaned in to kiss his temple. "Just interested in your continued life."
"I bet you say that to anyone," Midoriya said, but his usual bite was missing in his words when Aizawa's long fingers interlaced with his and tucked them into his pocket. It pulled the younger man in closer and he gave him a toothy grin. "Ready?"
"...Usually when someone finds out I'm sick, they leave."
"Don't be stupid," Aizawa said, "I'm not just anyone."
And Midoriya would have never guessed that the cold and effecient Eraserhead would be someone whose hands were so warm, as he guided him out of apartment complex.
The weight of money, of someone's desperate hope that he would just see tomorrow, was heavy and uplifting, all the same.

-

"Jin, I ..."
Midoriya placed his hand on Twice's chest and pushed him back.
"I'm done."
The blond blinked back at him.
"What?"
"I'm," he motioned at the two of them, "done with this."
Twice stared at him for a long moment, before his hands tightened on Midoriya's arms. It would leave brusies, but Midoriya didn't flinch.
"Let go."
"No no," he shook his head, "No, you're not. You're not leaving. // Leave, get out of here!"
The blond released him suddenly, like he realized tht he was holding a bomb, and Midoriya didn't flinch.
"Why? Why now?! Why are you leaving? // Why doesn't anyone stay!?"
Midoriya felt his heart prickle, like someone was picking it apart with hooks. It sunk into the soft part of his heart, making tiny puncture holes and tore out chunks of flesh at a time. And still, he kept his expression steady.
"Sorry," he said, the only honest part of this discussion.
"No! No! No!" Twice yelled out, his hands coming up to almost tear at his head. "Tell me! What did I do wrong? Was it the cigarettes? Because I'm a villain? You said it was okay! You said you liked me as I was! // I never liked you! Everyone lies! There was never a place here for me!"
He shook his head violently, and came to kneel in front of Midoriya.
"I can change! I can do it! There are things that I can change and I can do it for you! I hate this! Don't do this to me! // I love you! I loved you this whole time!"
Instead of outright contradicting himself, the back-and-forth of his bubbling thoughts came out like a raging storm. Twice, as he splintered down and began to crumble about, placed his head on Midoriya's knees. Without checking his trembling shoulders and hearing the broken cries, Midoriya's pants started to soak.
"Please..."
And Midoriya, who never realize that he was the fulcrum of Twice's life, the starlight of Twice's nights, the cool breeze on a hot day, the flowers that adorned his fields, 

-

And sometime after the seventh and before the 29th time, Dabi finally snapped.
"Why are you!" he yelled out, his voice just barely louder than the screeching sounds of tires just seconds before, "Always in the middle of some fucking taffic accident!?"
He turned to Midoriya, like the young man had any fucking clue. He shrugged back.
The man ran his hand through his hair and sighed deeply. "Can you go one goddamn day without someone trying to take your life?"
"If I die, you don't have to save me anymore."

-

"Be healthy, okay?"
"Shut up."
"Make sure you eat at least three meals a day-"
"I told you to shut up!"
Midoriya, who never did as he told, gave him a patient smile as he kept going. "Take a shower at least every two days, but brush your teeth twice a day-"
Dabi's hands grabbed his shoulders. "Stop," he said, eyes wide and vibrant, which was funny since people always associated death with darkening. There was nothing about Dabi that ever looked dim, he supposed.
"Dabi," Midoriya said, leaning in to brush their noses together, "Live a long life, okay?"
"You're awful," the man said, dropping his head onto his shoulder.
"And if we all go to the same place when we die, make sure you tell me about all the things you did, okay."
"I hate you," Dabi said, his arms tightening around his waist. "I hate you so fucking much."
Midoriya hummed back, small hands coming up to Dabi's back, and wondering if, he was in good health and had the capability to grow up properly, he would have grown taller than Dabi, or at least tall enough to hold the man properly. 
"Don't look so happy about leaving me," Dabi said quietly.
"Then, should I cry about how unfair it is and get angry about things I can't control?"
"That's a good place to start," he replied back.
Midoriya laughed, a crystalized sound that Dabi never wanted to say goodbye to.

-

"And when you killed other people? Did you think that they didn't have anyone important to them? That they weren't important to someone else?"
"Don't turn this around on me-"
"And that, since you have experienced suffering, that you should make others experience suffering as well?!"
And shigaraki scowled because it wasn't like Midoriya to care and mention it. They never talked about this and cared about it before. It wasn't something that they ever broached, and Shigaraki couldn't believe that-
"The crash that was caused included a large truck. A pharma truck that held a lot of medicine for a lot of different people. Like me. The blue pills that I take, when my fevers get so bad that I can't see and I can't do anything for a day and a half and need an IV-drip because I can't even eat? Yeah, those pills."
Shigaraki stared, eyes wide and mouth agape.
-that keeping the person you love safe and happy was a lot harder than it seemed.
"Shigaraki, the world isn't just you and heroes. The world includes everyone. When you fight to end the world, when you talk about collateral damage and civilians," he grabbed the man's hand and placed it against his chest, "it's me."
The heartbeat that pounded against his breastbone made Shigaraki flinch.

-

"...Shigaraki, take out the roads first. Then go for the hospital."
"What?"
"C'mon, even when we play games, it's obvious right? Lay on the buffs and debuffs, and take our their healer."
Shigaraki, who had been careful not to fuck up the supplier chain, stared back.
"Don't you need that stuff?" 
"The number of victims haven't changed," Midoriya replied back, "You just know the name of one."
And Midoriya couldn't have possibly known, since no one actually knew about this agreement, but Dabi shifted in his seat, blue eyes bright in their promise of death as he eyed Shigaraki. 
"Midoriya," Shigaraki said, "Shut up." As he always said when he knew Midoriya was right but he couldn't get the words out. 
That knowing smile on Midoriya's face annoyed him to no end.
"Don't let me get in the way of World Domination," the young man said with a cheeky grin, "I know you're stronger than that."
And on occasion, Shigaraki wished that they had never met. The whole 'Overthrow Current Society' would have been much easier if he didn't care about all the weak, bottom-feeders.

-

"That society you're trying to overthrow," Midoriya said, leaning against the wall with a warm smile, "Protects weaklings like me."
"Did a shit job of it, too," Twice muttered, carefully bandaging the nasty cut on Midoriya's leg.
A hand came to his chin, a soft touch that Twice followed without hesitation.
"What are you talking about?" he asked quietly, "It led me to you."
He leaned down, kissing Twice's forehead. 
"You haven't done a shit job."
The blond groaned, the conflicting feelings of frustratons that pinched when he saw the cut on Midoriya's leg clashing dangerously to the warm feelings engulfing his heart.
"That's not fair," he muttered, pulling his hand out of Midoriya's hands and laying his head in his lap instead. "That's just not fair."
Because Midoriya's hands were still trembling. 


### chit 

Gilgamesh stared down at her, and Gudako did her best to look anywhere but him. The dark look in his eyes, coupled with the bags under his eyes, contrasted the smile on his face as he leaned against her desk. Red eyes glowed for just a second as he took in her features.
"Mongrel," he said, voice so low that it felt criminal. 
"I don't know."
"
