### gentle nightmare

- former slave!Midoriya with a single-passenger plane crashlands in "No Man's Land" // "Dark Continent" where he finds massive things & people with quirks & demon-magic stuff 
- Midoriya wakes up on an island filled with monsters. Finds a harem of monsters that sorta look human. Which would be fine except he's as human as they came.
- people who used to be people but lost themselves to their 'demon' self, but wanna be human again (limited) ie become vizards lolol
- people who are fine being monsters/demons & all ie epsada
- Midoriya murdered everyone on the way out, confused and a little relieved that people don't know what the mark on his back is
- idk if i want ppl to come hunt him  down

[au to that emissary au]

-

The Dark Continent. The Nation of Savages and Dark Magic. It was on the tinge of hell, because only the dark, disgusting and dangerous could possibly survive in that kind of abyssal terror. 
In that area that only came in horror stories and children fairy tales, Midoriya staked hope. 
The chain on his ankle was heavy, but nothing was holding him back anymore. Hands caked in blood, Midoriya pulled and yanked at the consoles. It was one of the only ones like it in the world. 
It was his ticket out of here. It was his last Fuck You to the person that burned their mark onto his back.
"Get him!"
His mark burned. Slave Magic was strong, but Midoriya was far too desperate to turn back now. 
"Get that fucking slave!"
And Midoriya took off.

-

The last thing Midoriya remembered before his plane suddenly tipped off and crashed was that the Dark Continent didn't look dark at all.Instead, it looked beautiful. The amber lights of a bright sunshine touched down and it felt like everything bathed in its light glowed and shimmered and shined.
Or maybe it was because this was the first sunset after he was freed.
Maybe the world was just more beautiful now that he was free.

-

"If you want to keep my cot warm," Shigaraki said, an easy grin on his face and his eyes raking down Midoriya's figure and then back up, "I'll take care of you for the rest of your life."
Midoriya's eyebrows furrowed, but he didn't take a step back. Shigaraki's grin widened a little more, like this was a great thing, and he took a step closer. 
"I won't let you regret it," his voice dropped in pitch as he took another step closer to Midoriya.
The young man met his gaze evenly, just a bit wary. 
"What do you think?"
"It's not what I want. And if that means I won't be taken care of for the rest of my life, I think that's okay."
Shigaraki's grin quickly turned upside down. He tilted his head and spoke simply.
"If I kill you right now, you won't get what you want."
Midoriya's eyes shined, "Then you don't know what I want."
The man took a step back, "If you're looking for death, I can do that for you."
"I'm not looking for death," Midoriya replied, "but I'm not scared of it."
"Then what are you scared of?"
Midoriya stared at Shigaraki and then grinned like he knew a funny joke that the older man wouldn't know.
"Everything!"
Shigaraki's eyebrows furrowed, but at that second, several screaming sounded from outside of their hut. 

-

Midoriya was the one who was caught, tied up and thrown into a cage. He was the one that they tried to beat for information, and he was one that was tasted on their tongues.
And yet.
Compress gave Shigaraki a side-eyed glance, watching how their leader bit down on his knuckles until blood spilled. It was a new habit he's never seen the man do. 

Who? He wondered, who was really the imprisoned one here?

-

"You're human," Enji said, "You won't age with the rest of us."
Midoriya blinked. He placed his hand over his heart and then nodded.
"So if I want to turn, should I wait until I'm closer in age to you?"
The pinched expression on the older man's face was indecipherable, but he surged forward. Slanting lips across Midoriya's. Massive hands came to gently grip his chin. 
"I am," he said quietly when he pulled away, "doing my best to control myself." 
Midoriya gave a shaky exhale, licking his lips to take in the rest of Enji's taste on his tongue, and shivered at the way Enji's eyes darkened.
"If I... If I say that it's okay not to control yourself-"
Enji's hand covered his mouth. His eyes dropped to the ground as he took a deep breath. 
"Don't, Midoriya," he said. "Do not tempt me like that."
Hands came up to the hand on his mouth. Closing his eyes, Midoriya leaned into the touch, he opened his mouth and ran his tongue across Enji's palm-
The hand was ripped from his mouth with a snarl. Enji's chest heaved as he bared his teeth at Midoriya. Maybe if Midoriya was a demon, that might have had some effect, but this was Midoriya, a human who crashlanded into a land of monsters. What would he know about fear?
Midoriya flashed him a sheepish, almost shy kind of smile.
"I trust you," he said, probably having no idea about the weight his words held. "If you wanted to kill me, then you would have done that by now."
"Midoriya, there are fates worse than death."
"So I've been told," the young man agreed, "But you know, I don't think it'll be a fate with you."
Enji looked at him like he had cut his heart out. Midoriya wondered how it could be possible that someone as big as Enji, who fought and fucked with aggression and every breath he took exuded how much power under his skin.
"It's okay," Midoriya said, because the thought that someone cared enough about him and his well-being to hurt themselves trying to keep him safe was something he never got to experience until he met Enji.
So, if this man betrayed him, Midoriya knew he wouldn't be able to blame him. 
"I don't mind getting hurt for you or because of you."
And Enji looked at him like Midoriya shot him instead. 
"What's wrong with you?"


### betrayal?

Midoriya tilted his head, confused and pleased, and Dabi tilted his head with him. Was something missing? Was there something wrong?
"No, it's nothing," Midoriya said, staring at Dabi like he was beautiful, "I... It's nothing, don't worry about it."

-

"...That would have been the perfect opportunity to betray me," he explained.


### solo lvl

>> dabi moves out & into apartment 
>> natsuo moves in
>> midoriya stays at their place unitl he moves in
(( his place gets caught in a dungeon-break? he comes and deals with it))


Dabi's eyebrows creased, "Looks like it's still too big for you," he said. And while looking over his notes, creased his eyebrows and frowned. "You, have you lost weight?"
Midoriya tilted his head, "I... don't think so?"
A large hand reached to grab his wrist and pulled him closer. With an increasing frown and furrowed brows, summer blue eyes landed on his face, "You definately feel like it."
"Really? I can't tell."
"You been skipping meals again?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
"Uhm..."
Dabi's other hand came to his hip, and slowly moved up his chest. He gave a little hum, and tilted his head up to meet his eyes.
"You eat anything yet?" he asked, "Let's eat together today."
Midoriya took another step closer, his cheeks starting to dust as he nodded quietly.
Behind them, the salesclerk held a strained smile on his face.

-

Midoriya stared at the remains of the apartment.
"...Oh," Midoriya said quietly, "I'm homeless."
Kamui's head whipped towards the young man. No one died today, courtesy of the Best Supporter in all of Japan, but at the same time.
This rickety old apartment? The Best Supporter in all of Japan was staying here? Obviously not anymore, but surely he would have better housing than this. Standing next to Midoriya, he couldn't help but notice how small the young man looked. While he looked puny next to Endeavor, Nishiya had stood next to Endeavor before too. The man had a way to make people just feel small.
But next to him, in the flesh, Midoriya was tiny. He barely came up to his chest, kind of tiny. Like, Nishiya knew that kids were small but it was different seeing it like this. Compared to the amount of mana that came out of him just a few moments ago, it made him look smaller.
And yet this was a child who had been through more A-Ranks than him. 
"...The lease wasn't over," Midoriya said quietly. He turned to Nishiya, confused and a little frightened. "Do you think that means I have to pay for the cancellation fee?"
Without thinking, Nishiya blurted out his true thoughts.
"You can board with me until you find a place to stay, and we can help you make sure all the legalities are taken care of."
"There's no need for that."
Kamui jolted, as the Todoroki's appeared.
He heard that Midoriya spent a lot of time with Todorokis, but it didn't click in his head until he saw the eldest son walk forward. Immediately draping his arm around Midoriya, cold blue eyes narrowed at Nishiya.
"Thanks for the offer but we'll take it from here."
"Dabi!" Midoriya shined, previous grivances already forgotten. 
Touya's ice blue eyes seemed to thaw for just a second, as a large hand toussled green hair with an easy smile.
"You good?" he asked.
"Yeah, I... I didn't finish paying off my lease so I don't know what's going to happen with that contract," he said. "I don't think I have enough to pay for it, but I guess if I don't have to pay rent anywhere, I could get the money together..."
"Just stay with me until you figure that out," Touya said, rubbing his hair. "It'll make gate-raiding easier."
"R-Really?"
"Yeah, so don't think too hard about it."
As he said that, another Todoroki appeared, the Tanker. Kamui had heard that Midoriya was close to the Todorokis. He wondered if they were raiding someplace together before they came to stop of the dungeon break here. 
"It looks everything is in order. The Commission said they will take it from here. I went ahead and wrote our names down as well," Natsuo said. 
"W-Where should I put the extra mana crystals?" Midoriya said.
"They're yours," Touya said, "So, what do you want?"
Kamui thought about how that conversation would go. It wasn't like someone could just tell an S-Class like Midoriya what to do when most A-Rankers ignored direction.
"Do you think they could take the mana crystals to make sure that no one's lease contracts will damage them?"
"You sure? You could make a nice buck and buy a better jewel with it."
Midoriya stared at the crystal, and remembering that absolute horror Nishiya felt facing off that cyclops and the massive gem it dropped, Nishiya felt like the answer should have been easy.
"Okay," Midoriya nodded, "I can pass it over to them. Where's the Commisison?"
"You sure?" Natsuo asked.
The young man nodded, his hair bouncing with him, "We're all homeless now."
The gems that Nishiya gathered from taking out the B-Ranked horned imps felt heavier in his hand. Without looking back at him, the three left to go find a Commission member.
"Whoa!" Takeyama bounced up to him, "Senpai, we made bank today! You want steak for dinner? Maybe some Korean barbeque?!"
"I..." Nishiya thought about it. Back when he was an emerging hunter, his senpais used to take the mana stones he earned, because that's what a party did. When he opened his own guild and created his own party, he swore to himself that he would never do that kind of thing to his own partymembers.
Because that was the kind of person that he wanted to be.
"I'll take a rain check," he said, watching the civilains who were crying over the loss of life and propery and livlihood. "Takeyama, good work today. I'll see you in the office tomorrow."
"Yeah, I..." the blond stared for a moment longer, tilting her head to the side. Placing her shield on the ground, she leaned against it, "Senpai, what are you planning?" she asked. 
"...I think there's something that I can still do here," Nishiya said. He knew and understood that this was a selfish type of kindness, where he was only helping people because he saw someone else do it right in front of him. Come next week, he would have forgotten all about this.

### sat

"There's a monster here," Midoriya said, "Probably a big one."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" one of the other men shouted out, "No! I don't know what your deal is, but there are no monsters here! This is a safe zone!"
"And even if there was a monster here," one of alphas purred as he gave Midoriya a one-over, "Well, I'll take good care of you, omega dear. You don't need to worry about it."
Kido gave that man a hard nudge, his disapproing gaze staring at the man, but the alpha kept his eyes on Midoriya's figure. With a kid, Kido turned back, "While I don't approve of the way he said that, it does stand."
He looked between Endeavor, the hero that he admired the most, and then back to Midoriya. How could someone who traveled with Endeavor be so misled? Kido and the others, who managed to hole themselves into the train station, were probably luckier than the people who were fighting up above. 
"At the very least, you will be safe here. We have rotational guard, food, water, running electricity, the works," Kido said, "Take a break for today and tomorrow. There's plenty of work to be done, so I'm sure there will be something for everyone."
The alpha took another step closer to Midoriya, but Midoriya didn't back away. Maybe being with Endeavor for too long had given him a false sense of secuirty. While Kido believed that Endeavor had an insane amount of control over himself and his instinctual side, he couldn't garuntee that for everyone here.
Because really, an omega going around shirtless like that was going to do more harm than good. It would be different if circumstances were different, but at this time and place, the less that they had to deal with and worry about the better.
So.
"I'm sorry to say, but do you have anything you can wear to cover up?"
Midoriya stared at him for a moment longer, before he turned around.
"W-Where are you going?"
"Kido, I'm glad you're alright," Endeavor said.
"I..." Kido looked momentarily caught off-guard, eyes darting from the omega walking away and then back to Endeavor. "Yes, I'm glad you are well too," he said, and he meant it, but it probably didn't look that way since there was a defenseless omega walking away, "but you don't actually mean to let him go alone, do you?"
"We have a base further away," Enji said, "We came out here to see how it was here. Now that we know, we'll head be heading back."
"A base?"
Behind Kido, he could hear it. 
"Endeavor-san?"
"There's another base?"
"A base with Endeavor-san?"
And the same way Kido longed to follow someone else's lead and stop being as respoinsible for all these lives, he was certain the people behind him agreed. 
After all, Endeavor looked fresh. With a bit of dirt smudged and a little sweaty, but he looked good. Clean-shaven and well-rested, he looked almost as though society never ended. 
Kido had a good idea on what kind of base he must have come from. No wonder the omega didn't want to stay, wait.
"Then, is he... yours?" Kido asked, because Endeavor didn't strike him as the type to not mark what was his.
"Kido," Endeavor interuppted him, "Stay well."
And he turned around. Understanding that the man was leaving, the people that spent their time talking about their glossy future with Kido came surging to their feet.
"Wait, wait, Endeavor-san!"
"Is there, do you have any room with your base?"
While he undertood why they might have done this, it didn't make it any easier. If Kido could, he would abandon everyone here to go follow after Endeavor. Because if anyone wouldn't lose sight of reality and the future, it would be Endeavor.
"That's not up to me," Endeavor explained. 
"Let's stay in touch," Kido said. "At the very least."
The older man nodded, and an almost smile, the kind that Endeavor would have never given on patrol or ever, graced his features.
"Sounds good."

-

"Izuku," Endeavor called out, jogging to join the young man. "Kido explained to me that there are no monsters where they are. The stations are clean, in that sense. They've gone as far as four train stations from where they are, and make it a rotational habit to check them out."
Green eyes stared at him, wide in their surprise and Endeavor nodded.
"I don't think they realize that there is a monster there. From the looks of it, it looks like Kido was with a large number of civilians. I don't think he has the firepower to take on that monster either."
"Why are you here?" Midoriya blurted back. 
Endeavor stared at him, shocked.
"Ah," the young man covered his mouth, "I said that aloud. I meant... no, wait, your wife and children are back at the school. Forget I said that."
"I came back to you because that's what I wanted," he said, "It was not a sense of duty or responsibility, and it's not temporary either," he said. "I came back because it was my selfish desire."
A long silence stretched between them, and the former hero tried hard not to think about how young Midoriya looked when he was shocked speechless. He didn't even understand why Midoriya was so surprised. Did he really think that he was just waiting for a better opporunity? did he really think that there were better opportunities somewhere else?
"I... I see," Midoriya said, looking away first. He turned around quickly, "I..." he trailed off, and then he shook his head like he was shaking the thought out of his head.

-

"There's a monster here," Endeavor explained. "I let it get away and we chased it here."
"Oh, well that's alright, Endeavor-san. Mistakes happened to the best of us, after all. I mean, you're here to get it, right?"
"Yes. We will kill it."
"...We?"
Even though, with Endeavor were four other well-established and known alphas, all eyes fell right to the omega. The same omega that they dismissed the warning of before. 
"It'll be dangerous. Leave it to the strong and wait for them to come back. You'll only get in the way." 

-

>> giant boss

"Snipe," Midoriya;s voice suddenly called over the commlink, "Where are you?"
"15th Floor of the Hakuren Corp, sir."
"...Look out towards the west," Midoriya said, "and tell me if that mountain is moving closer."
"I..."
This was one of those moments that Midoriya hoped and prayed that he was being a silly little omega. He was making a big deal out of nothing. God, please, let him be wrong.
"...It's moving."
Midoriya placed his head in his hands. He never wanted to be more wrong in his whole life. 
"...Midoriya," Snipe spoke quietly, "Do we engage?"
Midoriya kicked down the door to the rooftop. He stepped out and made his way to the ledge. Indeed, the thing that he thought was a mountain was getting noticably closer than it did before. At the pacing it was at, it they probably had a month or so before it entered the residental area. 
Meaning, whatever it was, it needed to die before it got too close to their residental. It needed to die after it passed majority of their water sources and the area where the deer congregated. Given that, it was easy to tell when they needed to be ready to take it down, kill it there and do something about the body. He stared out.
"Not today," Midoriya replied, "Finish up patrol and we'll head back."

-

An uncertain silence fell over the base. It's been a while since things were so tense, or rather, maybe it was telling about how relaxed they had gotten over the last few years. 
At the very least, he supposed that it was good that Snipe saw it too, since they were taking him seriously. It also meant that they could get to work as soon as they were here.
"Kill it with fire," Dabi said, "Duh."
"Shoot it," Snipe said, "We got the firepower for it."
"Dismember it bit by bit until there's nothing left," Stain replied.
"Beat it till it stops moving," Miruko explained, cracking her knuckles for emphasis.
"Before we get too excited," Overhaul said, lifting his hand up to stop the conversation, "We're certain to kill it, right? Kill it and reduce it to nothing more than ash?"
"Haah? Of course we are," Shigaraki snapped back, "What kind of question is that?"
"...Because we don't know if it's alive," Midoriya replied back.
Realization dawned on several of the as they stared in shock.
"What the fuck? Of course it's..." Shigaraki's words trailed off. 
"It would be a mode of transportation," Midoriya informed them. "It could be a type of drone. We don't know."
Looking at the map, the young man tapped the approximate area that they figured it was.
"We will continue as we have," he said. "Meeting dismissed." 
"Wait, what? That's it?" Snipe asked. "No change of guard rotation? No preparations? Nothing?"
Midoriya was already turning to leave, wondering if he would find the upper limit of OFA after all.
"If you're calling our dismissal because you're going to go fight by yourself..." Dabi's tone was warning, but cut off when Midoriya opened the door and left. He hefted a great sigh. "...I don't know why I even bothered."
