"Udon, right?"
Chisaki raised his eyebrow. "Pardon?"
"We always get udon," Midoriya replied back. and then hegave a sheepish smile, "not today then?"
And Chisaki stared back, "Let's go," he said. "You have a place in mind?"
Midoriya pulled his phone out, "Nothing we can't figure out with Google."
Chisaki stared at him before his mask crinkled. Was he smiling? Was he grimacing? His eyes shined though, and he wondered if the man really liked his udon.
"Never thought I'd be asked out on such an impromptu date," Chisaki said, eyes like glimmering gold under the streetlights. "You make it hard to refuse."
Midoriya spluttered, his cheeks darkening, and Chisaki gave out this rich laugh. Momentarily, he felt bewitched. In a world without villains, in a world without heroes, Chisaki-san sounded incredibly young when he laughed.
"I know a good place, if you trust me?"
And since Midoriya felt tongue-tied at the handsome man, just nodded dumbly. 
"Excellent."

"The thought that someone had left their mark on what I cannot," Chisaki's voice dropped in pitch as he loomed over him, "Makes me upset."
And Midoriya, who seemed so untouchable before, trembled in front of him. Clearly terrified, but his eyes looked straight at him. This wasn't someone that was going to roll over and let someone else win. With that thought in mind, a burning desire to take him returned in full force. Indeed, he hadn't felt like this, not to this degree. 
Midoriya, who used to feel like a distant star, was now within arm's reach. 
Chisaki would be a fool to let this opportunity pass by him.
"Consider it," he said, "Becoming mine." He's always wanted to touch him. To share the same air, bask in the same warmth, he wanted it all. 
"I don't want to."
He spoke so frankly. The thought that this man could be his, made him shiver. 
"Are you sure?"
"But," Midoriya licked his lips, "You could be mine."
His eyebrows hiked up his forehead, and Chisaki let out a rich laugh.
"An enticing idea," he said, eyes shimmering. 
The young man still, leaned away from him, as best he could with his back against the wall. 
"Being someone else's," he said sternly, but when it fell from his trembling lips, it lost any intimidation factor, "shouldn't be enticing."
"How could I help what entices me?" he asked, stepping closer. He placed his hands on either side of Midoriya's head, leaning down, he wondered if Midoriya would ever grow a few inches, but also decided that he enjoyed the way he craned his neck to look up at him.
Enticing didn't even begin to describe it.
"Then, shouldn't you... understand that I'm not enticed by you?"
"Don't say such hurtful things," Chisaki chuckled back, "I'm more fragile than I look."
He ran the back of his fingers over his cheek, and resisted the urge to lean in and kiss him. That would have to wait for the third date. Even he had things that he wouldn't try to ruin, after all.
"Consider it," he said. "A life where you are as loved as you are powerful."
"I think you're asking the wrong person," he replied back, bullheadedly.
And Chisaki wondered if Midoriya knew how unconvinving he looked when he said that. Like he truly, desperately wanted to be [someone] to anyone, and Chisaki wanted to corret him.
Because to Chisaki, he would be...

"Be careful," Akakuro said, "That guy's yakuza."
Midoriya stared at him. "And?"
"He's dangerous."
Midoriya blinked at him and then gave this laugh. The sound of it made Akakuro flinch. 
"Dangerous, huh?" Midoriya tilted his head with a smile on his face, as though Akakuro said something funny. "When you say dangerous, what do you think?"
The older man frowned, and then his eyes trailed down to where the span of scar that rested across Midoryia's forewarm, spelling out a foul word that had nothing to do with the young man in front of him.
"Would I be hurt? Will they beat me? Torture me? Film it and make money off of it?" he asked, voice gentle like the time he asked if he wanted to stay for dinner. "Is that what you mean about danger? That they would make me feel like I want to die?"
Akakuro's jaw clenched tightly.
"Are you going to tell me that I don't know what danger is?"
His smile was patient. Akakuro felt like a child, chastised for running mud into the house.
Midoriya sat down, getting comfortable, and looked back at Akakuro, expectedly.
When Akakuro was a cihld, he used to think that adults were all useless. Now that he was an adult, he understood how powerless he really was.
"You might make a decision that you can't take back," he said. 
Midoriya stared at his hands, and then nodded. 
"What did you want me to say?" he asked. "Should I blindly agree with you? Would you rather I lie?" His smile took a bitter tone, and Akakuro felt his heart crack.
Midoriya, who used to wait for him so that they could get udon together, tilted his head with an expression he didn't think he had been capable of.
"I imagine that it's even harder for you, since I have your beloved Izuku's face, right? I can't imagine it. Since I've never been important to anyone, or had anyone important to me."
But Akakuro had somthing for that. He could finally finds his words again. He relaxed.
"You are important to me," he said, "Deku, you have always been important to me. I... I'm sorry that I don't know how to show it," he said. "You're right. My words are meaningless. Despite my proclamation to protect, I know nothing about you. I'm sorry. I was thoughtless."
Akakuro dipped his head forward, hoping that Midoriya would take his words with sincirity, and hoping that he would carry this like a vow for the future. 
Midoriya once, a long time ago when he could carry the radiance of the sun in his smile, asked him if it was possible. If [Kindness] could be enough to save someone.
"I don't know what you need. I don't even know where to begin. But if there's something that I can do for you, I'll do it. It sounds insincere. I know, but I'll start with this."
He reached up and grabbed Midoriya's wrist. Yanking him forward, his hand slid up to where that foul word sat.
"The kid who did this to you, I'll give him a life worse than death."
He would be lying if he said he wasn't itching to deal his own brand of justice. The things that Midoriya experienced, so that he hesitated when opening any door, so that he flinched when someone laughed too loudly, so that he would look so confused when Akakuro offered help, was something beyond forgiveness. Before, Midoriya never mentioned it, but this was different. If Midoriya wanted revenge, Akakuro would gladly set that up. It didn't matter what it took. It didn't matter if there was nothing left of him. 
"I don't want that."
Akakuro blinked. He stared at Midoriya for a moment. "Are you worried about... repurcussions? When it comes to avoiding responsibiliy, there's no one better at it than an adult, don't you think?"
The young man stared at him for a moment longer and then shook his head.
"But you're... precious to someone else, right?" he asked, uncertain even though he used to be the only person that would ever call him [preicous]. "So, I don't... I don't want you to do this."
If only Midoriya was here, Akakuro thought to himself. Then he would have answered his own question.

"But senpai, you're almost 17. If you get caught for something like murder, you'll go to prison after being tried as an adult."
Midoriya flinched, and he stared at the young child pensively. 
"Isn't that a waste?"
He grinned back, "Instead of that, I'll go in. I'll be out when I'm 18, so just sit tight for me, okay?"
Fu laughed at the expression that Midoriya made.
"But... Why?"
He grinned, "Because when we didn't know each other, you made me feel like that. So while you don't know me, I want you to feel the way I did."
He stopped for a bit, and then his cheeks darkened.
"But you know, that's pretty romantic, huh?" he asked, "going to prison for someone, coming out and knowing that even if society moved on, one person waited. I might fall in love with you all over again, Senpai."
Midoriya felt his skin crawl. Hearing someone call him senpai so affectionately scared him. He took a step back, and the young man, his underclassman, took a step closer. Towering over him (seriously, what the hell did they feed these children these days), he smiled until his eyes turned to slits and Midoriya understood. 
Reaching out, he took his head.
"You don't have to," he said, "I won't do it."
"Oh? You don't trust me?"
Midoriya shook his head, and squeezed his hand tightly. Staring at the ground, he found his ords as he looked back up.
"Let's get meatbuns by the station," he said. "Today, and next week. Next month and so on." He gave a small smile, "We're too busy to go to prison."
That cruel-looking smile fell. His jaw slackened. His eyes widened. Midoriya smiled back.
The face of a person who had been lonely for far too long was one that he was accustomed to, after all. 
"I think it's more romantic to spend two years together, than spend it apart."




### limited collection

"We need money," Aizawa announced. "So," he pointed at Midoriya, "Stop taking quests without rewards." He pointed at Dabi, "Stop slacking off at work." And then pointed at Vlad King, "Stop trying to sample our clients." And then pointed at Fatgum, "You just..." he hesitated before ultimately deciding on, "Keep up the good work."
With a frown on his face, Dabi scowled. 
"What about yourself."
Red eyes immediately turned back to Midoriya. His soft looking hair, his gentle-looking eyes, and looked away.
"I'll stop getting distracted."
Blue eyes narrowed. "How's that going for you?"

-

The slave mark finally faded from Aizawa's skin. If he was being honest, it didn't feel any different.
He supposed that's how free-ranged that Midoriya kept him. He looked up, to the worried eyes of his Master.
"I've been waiting a long time to do this," he said, grabbing his hand and leaning down.
The first kiss of his freed life was sweet. He didn't know if it was because it was Midoriya he was kissing, or because he was free.


### backline tanker

"So uh... this used to be your place, huh?" Natsuo asked.
Midoriya didn't respond as his magic patched up places where the ceiling was starting to cave and missing parts of the drywall. He stumbled in, surprising Natsuo and Dabi, because normally, the first thing that someone lost when their concentration broke was their control over mana. Instead, Midoriya stumbled but his magic didn't even stutter.
"Midoriya?"
And the young man sprinted for the back. All the hair on Natsuo started to stand as he rushed after him. Even though he knew and understood that they were within Midoriya's barrier, and they weren't in a Gate, the thought that his supporter was going somewhere he could not see made him nauseous. He gave his brother a quick glance before they ran after him. 
In one of the bedrooms, Midoriya was reaching under the bed, and pulled out a small box. 
"I-It's okay," he said, "It's safe."
"Midoriya, please don't run off like that," Natsuo said, kneeling next to him. "At least warn me, okay?"
"I-I just wanted to check-"
"Please, Midoriya."
Midoriya looked down and slowly nodded his head. "Sorry."
"You're fine," the tanker replied. "I just... I know you're strong enough to take care of yourself. It just... scared me."
"What were you looking for?" Touya asked, coming up behind his brother.
"It's important to me," Midoria said quietly, cradling the box against his chest. It was an old shoebox, but the disconcerning part was the amount of magic that was sealed on it. Even though it was a small thing, the fact that Midoriya probably had that magical spell on that box, at all times no matter where he was, had him blanaching. 
Natsuo looked to his brother, who shrugged back.
"I'll come back with some more bags," he said. "Grab what you need now, and we can put everything else into a storage until you get a new place."

-

"My lease is about to end," Touya said, lying through his teeth. "Midoriya, if you want, let's move in together."
"I..." Midoriya looked up at him, "Really?"
Natsuo thought about it. Midoriya was finally starting to fill out. If he started to live alone again, especially when everyone's eyes were all trained on him. 
"Sounds good to me," Natsuo said.

-

Living with Midoriya was everything and more. They lived in an upscale, single-bed apartment. Which. When Natsuo moved in and lived on the couch, was sorta okay, but now that there were three of them who were romantically involved with each other, was starting to feel a little more dicey. 
Maybe since Midoriya was no longer concerned about finding another place to live, or because he was starting to get comfotable, he usually sat right next to Natsuo or Dabi. He sat, curled up so that his knees were to his chest, and leaned his head against their chest, and moving one of their arms around him.
And he'd fall asleep like that. Which was fine. And actually, adorable. Natsuo had taken a few pictures once he stopped the initial panic and set it as his background. 
But he wasn't a monk. He wasn't a saint. He was Midoriya's Tanker, yes, but he was a man. With needs. 
"Don't pop a boner when he's sleeping," his brother, who had no tact or shame, told him to his face. 
Natsuo felt his face burn. Covering his eyes with his arm he groaned.
"I'm not... trying to," he hissed out.
Touya's lips curled into a smile. Natsuo suppressed the urge to hiss at him.
"He's cute."
"The cutest," Natsuo amended.
His brother gave him this look, and nodded his head.
"Undoubtedly."
"We should take him to bed," he said.
"Nii-chan, take him on a date first," Natsuo gasped, scandalized. 
The older man rolled his eyes, "I have. Like forty of them."
"Gates don't count. Food after Gates don't count either. Going shopping for Raid-equipment doesn't count either."
Touya scoffed. "He's going to hurt his neck sleeping like that," he replied back. "I'll put him in his bed."
"I'll do it."
Touya pointed at his crouch. "No, you're not."
Feeling as though his cheeks were burning, Natsuo lost his ability to fight back. Touya carefully took Midoriya into his arms, a small smile gracing his lips, and Natsuo was glad that he hadn't lost that.
