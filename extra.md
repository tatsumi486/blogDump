"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

"Hm?"
Midoriya tilted his head, blinking blearily as Kan curled up behind him. The larger man placed his head on his shoulder and wrapped his arms around his middle.
"It's ... okay," Midoriya slurred out, his hand came up to the man's head, giggling when his fingers ran through short locks. "Hungry?"
And Midoriya wouldn't know how desperately Kan wanted to sink his teeth into his neck. He wouldn't know that Kan had sunk his teeth into his own arms on several occation, just to stave that feeling away. He knew what the [bite] did to humans. He knew, and it would

"It's irresponsible!" Aizawa snapped back. "Your making promises to stay with them, but you're just going to run off, aren't you?"
Midoriya jerked back, and his eyebrows furrowed. "I... what?"
"That's what you're looking for, isn't it? A way back? You're just binding your time, waiting for the opportunity an fillit it up with frivilous nonscense until you leave!"
Midoriya stared back for a moment and then answered curtly, "I'm not going back."
Aizawa froze.
"What?"
"My... my world. The place I was born. I'm not going back there. I'm staying here for the rest of my days."
"I... why?"
Midoriya smiled back.
"When I took your contract," he said, "I decided that I would stay here." 
Aizawa stared at him. "But you wanted to go home."
"I do," Midoriya nodded, "but I like being with you too."
And Aizawa, who never thought about the possibility that someone would choose him, stared back.
"I've been treating you awfully."
"Not really," Midoriya replied back.
"I could have been gentler."
"I didn't mind."
Aizawa's voice broke and his chest heaved.
"I don't have to say goodbye?"
Midoriya nodded. "Not until you want to."

"...There's conditions?" Midoriya gasped. "I can't just... free them?"
The man at the receptionist desk gave him a half-hearted smile, "Well, no."
And instead, he learned that undoing a [slave contract] was much harder than setting one on. Starting from the cost to buy a [curse-breaker], to the amount of mana that they would need to pour into breaking a life-long promise, and that wasn't even talking about the other underyling conditions that could follow a slave, depending on how long they were a slave, how they were used, and more.
"Does that make sense?" he asked, "that it's so hard to free a slave?"
"It's not worth it," the receptionist said. "But it's to discourage slaves from running away."
People who promise slaves their freedom if they work hard enough include the freeing of the slaves, were cruel. Midoriya understood how cruel it must have sounded now. He buried the hurt and the guilt.
["People aren't like you, Master."]
"And there's no other way?"
"Any attempts to break slave-magic will result in the death of the caster and the slave," the man replied back. "...Is it someone you know? Sorry to say, but it might not be worth freeing them."
There hadn't been a lot of instances where Midoriya lost himself in his anger. However, he had spent many nights, where Yamada laughed and then stopped laughing and apologized for being too loud. Or moments where Aizawa was about to doze off but jolted awake because it was wrong to sleep before his Master. He thought to that, and didn't even realize that he had broken the man's nose until Hawks' arms were wrapped around his waist and hauling him off of him.

"Yeah, so we've been asked to leave the premise," Hawks explained.
"But we just got here," Dabi said, arms full of groceries. He placed them on the small table. "We just got here."
And he must have sensed something, because he tilted his head to where Midoriya was quietly standing behind Hawks.
"It's my fault," he said quietly, "Sorry about this."
"Wait, what?" Shigaraki sat up on the bed, "Is it actually your fault or are we getting the blame for something else?"
"I threw the first punch," Midoriya said. "Let's go. Where are the others?"
"Sight-seeing," Inui said, concerned eyes focused on Midoriya. "Are you..."
"We need to be out by sundown when the borders close," the young man said. "Hawks, can you go collect them?"
The blond hesitated, probably unhappy to be sent away when Midoriya looked like that, and he took a step in to kiss his head.
"Alright, I'll go at my fastest."
And out the window he went. 
Midoriya went to the bed, and realizing that they didn't even unpack, covered his face with his hands. He took a deep breath.
"Hey," Shigaraki's voice called out to him, eyes narrowed. "What happened?"
"...I..." he looked at the man, his eyes watering, "I'm weak."
Shigaraki, mildly alarmed at the fact that he was crying, scowled. 

-

"Okay," Midoriya said, "We did it!" He turned to Aizawa and Yamada, absolutely shining, "Are you ready to be freed?!"
Yamada cheered, but Aizawa deadpanned back "Get on with it."
The blond frowned, "Aw come on, Shota, let him be happy. It's cute."
"The faster we're freed," Aizawa replied, "the more time we'll have to be free."
The blond nodded and turned to Midoriya, "He has a point."
And Midoriya laughed back. Lifting his hand up, he gave them a nod, "Then, let's get on with it."
Shigaraki sighed and Chisaki rubbed the back of his neck.
"I can't believe this," Shigaraki grumbled, "they're not even my slaves, but it's my mana that has to do it."
"Can't be helped," Chisaki replied back. "Let's get this over with."
Hawks landed next to Midoriya. "Alright, we got the barrier up. Whenever you're ready."

"Bard," Dabi called out to Yamada, ignoring the incredulous sound the man made, "Play some music."
"You could be nicer," Midoriya sighed.
"Fine, fine," Dabi rolled his eyes, "Bard. Music. Please."
The human gave this exasperated huff but Dabi's eyes shined. He extended his hand towards him.
"Come on," he said, "Let's dance."
"Do you even know how to dance?" Midoriya asked, reaching up to take his hand.
"Don't you know?" Dabi asked, snaking his arm around his waist and yanking him close, "Dancing's just an excuse to stand close to someone."
He kissed Midoriya's nose, his grin widening when Midoriya's laugh reverberated between them.
"You don't need an excuse for that," Midoriya replied back, his eyes shining. But still, he placed his hands onto Dabi's shoulders. 
And Dabi's wide grin softened just a bit. It made the question sit on the tip of his tongue. What was he thinking about, that he would look at Midoriya so gently? 
Midoriya would never forget the grin on Dabi's face, for as long as he was alive. He could only hope that it would become a more common sight.
