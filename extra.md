Sawada Tsunayoshi had disappeared for fiv eyears when Midoriya Izuku came into their lives.

-

"You cry because you're sad," Midoriya said. "It's okay."
"He needs to stop crying and grow up. Tsuna's dead. Has been for a while now. Move on."
Lambo's lips twisted into a scowl, electricity starting to track when Midoriya stood in front of him.
"It's okay," he said, "to cry because you miss someone and to be sad."
Reborn's gaze was cold, "And what would a child know about that?"
"Shut up, Reborn!" Lambo snapped back, "Not everyone is a cold-blooded and unfeeling bastard like you! Tsuna-nii did everything for you! Broke your curse! Fought for you! You don't-"
Midoriya's small hand grabbed Lambo's hair and yanked hard.
"No!"
The other two stared, startled.
"Crying doesn't mean sad, and sad doesn't mean crying!"
"Huh?"
"Because some people forget," Midoriya said, the youngest among them in a hundred different ways, "it doesn't mean that they're not sad. It means they forgot how to cry."

-

"Just shut up and let me protect you, Tsuna!"
And as the words came out of his mouth, Reborn realized what he had said. The silence between them was suffocating. 
Midoriya stared for a long time, looking at his feet and then back up.
"...I never saved you."
And he turned around to leave.
He didn't want to Replace Sawada Tsunayoshi, Vongola's Tenth. He didn't. He wanted to save these people who couldn't cry even though they were sad.

Sawada Tsunayoshi had disappeared for five years when Midoriya Izuku came into their lives with a letter from Vongola Decimo, and a key to the Vongola Mansion in his hands.

Ie Sawada died(?) via AFO(?), but knew it was coming so wrote a letter to a Hero (Hypter Intuition), and so Midoriya Izuku (10) came to the Vongola Mansion, a letter in his hand, because that's what All Might would do.

Quirkless, Flameless Midoriya Izuku ends up in the middle of a godawful. 

-

"You cry because you're sad," Midoriya said. "It's okay."
"He needs to stop crying and grow up. Tsuna's dead. Has been for a while now. Move on."
Lambo's lips twisted into a scowl, electricity starting to track when Midoriya stood in front of him.
"It's okay," he said, "to cry because you miss someone and to be sad."
Reborn's gaze was cold, "And what would a child know about that?"
"Shut up, Reborn!" Lambo snapped back, "Not everyone is a cold-blooded and unfeeling bastard like you! Tsuna-nii did everything for you! Broke your curse! Fought for you! You don't-"
Midoriya's small hand grabbed Lambo's hair and yanked hard.
"No!"
The other two stared, startled.
"Crying doesn't mean sad, and sad doesn't mean crying!"
"Huh?"
"Because some people forget," Midoriya said, the youngest among them in a hundred different ways, "it doesn't mean that they're not sad. It means they forgot how to cry."

-

"Just shut up and let me protect you, Tsuna!"
And as the words came out of his mouth, Reborn realized what he had said. The silence between them was suffocating. 
Midoriya stared for a long time, looking at his feet and then back up.
"...I never saved you."
And he turned around to leave.
He didn't want to Replace Sawada Tsunayoshi, Vongola's Tenth. He didn't. He wanted to save these people who couldn't cry even though they were sad.

-

"...Kufufu," Mukuro chuckled behind his hand, "What happened to that child that flew to Italy at the tender age of 10 to knock on the doors of the oldest Familia in the world to save the leftovers?"
Midoriya frowned back, "They weren't leftovers."
Heterochromatic eyes stared back, and in a few seconds, it melted into a small smile.
"There he is."
Green eyes blinked at him, and he dropped his gaze. "I..."

-

"Shounen, you know who those... men are?"
Midoriya gave a shallow nod, and Tsukauchi stiffened.
"I-I see," All Might deflated a little, "How... did you uh... meet them?"
"I came over to their house over the summer when I was ten," Midoriya said, "I... wasn't welcomed."
The blond's expression melted into something else.
"I see," he said, "Midoriya-shounen. You will always be welcomed here. Please don't feel shy if there is something bothering you."
Midoriya felt an old bullet wound throb as he wondered how All Might would have saved the mourning. 
"...Thank you, All Might-san." He gave a wide grin, "I won't let you down."

-

"...What?"
Midoriya's voice was so confused, so shocked, and even he seemed surprised that he spoke at all. His hand came up to his lips and he tilted his head to the side.
"I... I didn't meant to make an outburst," he said, "but I... I was just surprised. I..."
"What's so shocking, kora?"
"I didn't think you'd notice if I was there or not," Midoriya admitted. "I thought, if you did notice, you would want me to leave."
The older man stared back, blue eyes wide and for a momnet, his entire expression went blank. A hand came up to his neck as he tried to find his words, and Midoriya quickly started speaking again.
"I'm not trying to make you feel bad or-or anything!" Midoriya said, waving his hands in front of himself, "And I understand why you were so upset, and I'm not upset about it either!" He took a step back, as though some more distance between them would make a difference at this point. "It's okay, I don't mind. Really, no problem! I was just caught off guard, but it's really nothing, don't worry about me! I guess you probably had a job here and just happened to run into each other. Yeah, that makes more sense! So, since we have nothing to do with each other, I'll just take my leave and-"
"I came for you, kora."
Midoriya's jaw clicked shut.
"...Is that what takes you to shut up? Telling the truth?" Colonello asked, a bitter sound bubbling out from between his lips. His hand ran through his hair and he took a deep breath and bowed his head forward.
"I'm sorry. For what I said before," he said, "that you're useless and meaningless and that you're just waiting to get mowed down."
Midoriya flinched backwards, and Colonello wondered what happened that someone who would hold their ground when shot at and screamed at, but coil back when apologized to. 
"Co... Colonello-san, it's not really anything worth apologizing for. Please, it's nothing like that. I-"
"It's unacceptable, isn't it?" the blond asked, "Yeah, I didn't think that you'd forgive me either."
"There's nothing to forgive because you didn't do anything wrong."
Colonello stared at him for another moment, before he took two stes forward. With his long legs, the distance between them closed immdiately. The blond raised his hand up and Midoriya immediately recoiled. Eyes wide and stiff, but he didn't back down. Gently, as though he wasn't Colonello at all, he ran his fingers through Midoria's hair.
"...How can you say that and still flinch backwards that much, kora?"
Midoriya stared up at him, uncertain and silent. "I... It's not..." still, he couldn't find the words.
"Exactly," Colonello said, "I'm sorry." He gave a wide grin, unlike anything Midoriya had ever seen before on him. "This time, I'm here to save you."
Midoriya's eyes watered.
"So, what do you want to do?"
"...I wanna be a hero," Midoriya said, "but I don't know how to save anyone."

-

"Y-You what?!"
Midoriya didn't hesitate, and remained firm in his stance between them.
"I want to save him."
Reborn paused for a second before lifting his gun to Midoriya's forehead.
"Alright, you willing to die for him?"
"I don't want to die," the young, hero-in-training replied, "but I don't want to live pretending like everything is okay just because that's convienent for me."
He brought his fists up, and it was almost mockingly stupid, because what could flame-less, quirkless Midoriya even do against the Number 1 Hitman? 
"I'm trying to protect you."
"No, you're projecting an image of Tsunayoshi-san on me and are trying to protect that."
Reborn fired the gun, tearing off a chunk of Midoriya's shirt and giving him a nasty cut across his arm. The young man tensed, but closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he opened his eyes, he looked just as determined as he did before.
And Reborn pulled his gun away. Without another word, another smart remark or witty comment, he was gone. 
"...Why... did you help me?"
Midoriya turned around to the girl in front of him. The wide-eyed way she stared at him before her jaw set in a painful and defensive way.
"Don't think that I owe you anything! I never asked you to save me!"
"No, you didn't," Midoriya said. "Do you need any help getting anywhere?"
"Stay away!"
Green eyes stared at her for a moment longer before he dipped his forehead.
"Okay, I don't know where you're going. But good lck."
"...I... What? That's it?"
And with a new scratch on his arm and a painful panging in his chest, Midoriya moved on.


### limited collection

Aizawa paused, arms full of damn groceries and turned over his shoulder with a scowl on his face because where the fuck was his Master-
The unremarkable shade of green was nothing special, and Aizawa would have to work extra hard to keep his eyes peeled for someone who leaned more towards average than anything else, and actually found him quickly. Aizawa took a deep breath, barely able to focus on him through the throngs of people, and slowly shoved his way through the crowd to get to his wayward Master. 
A scowl on his face, he managed to shove all the groceries onto one arm to reach his free arm to grab Midoriya's wrist in a near brusing grip.
"Master," he almost hissed out, "did something catch your eye? Do you have any plans on finishing the rest of the errands today?"
"O-Oh," Midoriya stuttered, a [Master] speaking to his [slave], and a soft pink dusted his cheeks. "S-sorry about that, Aizawa-san."
Looking at them, who would ever guess that one was enslaved? Who would ever speak so formally to someone beneath them?
His annoyance curbed now that he had all the groceries and his Master accounted for.

-

"Aizawa-san, we have some cockarice meat left. Do you want to eat it for dinner?"
Aizawa gave Midoriya a whithering stare, but he was exhausted. The trip to the market was hellish, packed between bodies under the swoltering summer heat, and he felt like he wanted to lay down for three years in the shade. 
"Whatever you wish," he replied back, curt and much too rude as expected of an unruly slave like himself. 
It wasn't like they were in a dungeon. A cockarice was an A-Rank beast. No one would be foolish enough to try and feed some scrapey slave something that exotic and powerful. More importantly, who the hell would cook for their slave? It should be that they cook for themseves, and if there is anything unedible or leftovers, then Aizawa would be fed.
Feeling as though he was waiting for the earth to splinter from under his feet, Aizawa sat in the corner of the room next to the room, and waited for something to fall within expectations.

-

"Is it okay if I tell you that I love you then?"
And Midoriya, who usually had some witty comment, didn't respond. Dabi turned his head, curious on if he had finally made him so upset that he couldn't speak, and instead felt the world slow down. He blinked, surprised, as he took in Midoriya's cherry red face. 
The surprise died down, and he gave a wide grin.
"What's wrong, Midoriya?" he teased, "Is it because I told you that I love you?"
"S-shut up!" Midoriya flinched backwards, covering his ears with his hands. Dabi couldn't believe that a kid who didn't blink twice at meeting a dragon was the same kid in front of him. "Y-you shouldn't say things you don't mean. Someone... might take you for real."
Blue eyes, somehow brighter than the strech of clear skies above them, remained focus on him as he leaned in. A long arm wrapped around Midoriya's shoulders as he tugged the young man closer. Pressing a kiss to the top of his ear, he chuckled.
"How sweet, Midoriya," he purred. "You make my heart race."
"Oh my god," Midoriya spluttered out, shoving the taller man away, and the taller man reluntantly released him, "You're ridiculous."
But there was a smile on his face, and Dabi supposed they had plenty of time for Dabi to prove that he wasn't lying. 
Behind him, grinding down on his teeth, Aizawa glared daggers at the back of Dabi's head. 

-

The magic was blinding. In a little circle, just big enough for the two of them, the man named Hawks remained kneeling in front of Midoriya.
"Midoriya!" Aizawa's voice was sharp, but it sounded so far away. Midoriya, so engrossed in what was happening in front of him, didn't even notice. 
"Until my body returns to earth, until my spirits becomes nothing, my heart will allign with yours, my breaths will be measured by yours, and I will be nothing without you."
Hawks magic was golden, like someone was melting gold all around them but it shined and shimmered like it was reflecting sunlight off of it. The blinding brightness made it look like Hawks was glowing, and coupled with his wings folded behind him, it was almost like there was an angel casting a spell in front of him.
Hawks lifted his eyes to meet his. There was a nagging feeling in the back of his mind, one that implored him to take a step back because there was something he wasn't seeing, but the rest of him could only focus on the warmth of the magic swirling around him.
"I offer my blood, my name, my life and all it encompasses to you," he said, "This is my [Oath of a Paladin]."
"...Alright," Midoriya nodded his head, "I accept-"
Hawks shot up to his feet, snatching Midoriya's hands and pulling them to his lips, his eyes trained on Midoriya's face with an uncanny amount of focus. A grin stretched on his lips, and a hundred warning bells started to ring in Midoriya's head.
"Then, to seal the deal," an arm wormed its way around Midoriya's waist, and he yanked Midoriya against him. With his hands pinned between them, Hawks leaned in to kiss him. At Midoriya's quiet gasp, his tongue pushed in, and eagerly mapped out Midoriya's mouth. He pulled back with a loud sound, features flushed as his eyes seemed to glow. The magic seal died down, and Hawks licked his lips as he slowly took a step away from Midoriya.
When Midoriya's knees buckled, Aizawa surged forward, shoving Hawks to the side as he helped Midoriya to sit on the ground. The young man shivered against his hold.
"Wha...?" his tongue felt numb, and his mind searched frantically through the haze in his mind. 
"Thank you for accepting my [Oath], Master. I won't let you down."

-

"So, in the time it took me to," Dabi looked down at the bag in his hands, as though to remind himself what the hell he was doing while this all happened, "buy a loaf of bread, you contracted a [Paladin]."
And then, the man turned to Aizawa, like Aizawa had any chance way or reasoning to control, stop, or mitigate anything that Midoriya did. He rubbed his temples. If he could, Dabi wouldn't be here, after all. 
"...[Dragonkin]?" Hawks whistled. "Impressive." 
Dabi grinned back, all teeth and no joy. 
"I can't say the same for you."
"It's fine, it's not like anything you say or do will matter in the long run."
Dabi stiffened, and the blond smiled back, bright but unfriendly. 
"The shit I deal with," Aizawa muttered darkly as he covered his face with his hands. 
"The shit you deal with?" Dabi scoffed.
"If you don't like it, just leave," Hawks said, waving his hand. "From here on out, I'll take care of Izuku."
"Is there... any way to break this oath?" Midoriya asked quietly, "between you and me?"
Hawks stared at him, gaze sharp but his smile didn't budge. Looking at him, Midoriya felt something inside of his heart coil uncertainly, like he had said something wrong.
"Nope. Nothing at all," Hawks said, "When you die, I'll die, and if we're born again, I'll find you again. We'll be stuck, together forever." 
"A curse more than an oath," Dabi commented.
"How unromantic," Hawks replied back, "But I guess that's to be expected from a dying race."
"At least we don't accept any stray mutt off the street."
"Yeah, and who's the one that's still surviving?"
"I wouldn't call forcing an ignorant child into an [Oath] something to be proud of."
"That makes sense, since you've never had much pride to begin with."
Dabi worked his jaw. Hawks' smile was frigid.

-

"Wait," Midoriya blanched. "So you mean, if I didn't accept your oath, you would have died?"
The blond's smile didn't even twitch.
"But... If I accept your oath, you'll just die because of me instead?"
Hawks kept smiling. 
"That's..." Midoriya stared at his hands, "God, that's awful."
The blond's expression melted into something a little more somber, as he kneeled in front of Midoriya.
"Is it? For us [Paladins], it's an honor to have a Master worth dying for."
Midoriya frowned, "What if I'm not? I men, I agreed because i wanted to save Dabi from," he eyed the sleeping man on the bed, and then to his hands, "but I didn't want to... to enslave you or anything."
Hawks laughed.
"Actually, you didn't need to contract me to save him."
"...What?"
"I'm a [Paladin]," he explained, "This kind of thing is a piece of cake for me."
"Then..."
"I just wanted you."
He gave a toothy grin. 
Midoriya's jaw dropped. "What."


### wither

"I wanna wear one," Twice said, "A veil."
Midoriya tilted his head to the side, turning to stare at Twice, imaginging how he would look with one of those frilly, see-through lacey things, and gave a small hum.
"Alright," he said, "I think we can do that."
Twice's arm wrapped around his waist and he pulled him close. Midoriya's hands came to his shoulders immediately, a giggle on his lips before Twice's lips sealed them up. He pushed a little more, dipping Midoriya back before pulling back with a loud smack.
And more important than a veil... 
"I love you," he said, brightening when Midoriya's cheeks pinked.
"I love you too, Jin," Midoriya replied back, just as excited, just as bright, and left Jin just as breathless as the first time.

-

"Do you think that people can change?"
"Think it?" Dabi snorted, "I know it." 

### sat

It was expected to fight. Of course it was expected to fight. He used to be a Hero. Protect people was first and foremost. 
And still, Deatharms felt exhausted. He couldn't lift his arms past his elbows. The weight that laid across his shoulders might as well have been a noose, and he should have died a long time time ago. 
Before, when life didn't feel like prelude, he thought that he could handle anything. Now, he understood that it was a delusion.

"I have to protect you! I have to-"
"No! You really don't!"

-

"Ten minutes."
Their commlink crackled to life, and Midoriya's voice carried through. 
"Stay alive for ten minutes. Don't let the monster leave that room."
Ten minutes?
Enji scowled. 
Him? Relief? That someone would come nad save him so long as he waited ten minutes?


-

Midoriya Hisashi was quiet and otherwise unnoticeable.
"Selkie, good to see you," Gang Orca said, clasping the other maritime hero with a firm handshake.
"Really, what a sight for sore eyes," Selkie said, eyes a little misty as he took in the sight of Gang Orca. "It's great to see you."
The older man took a step back, and looked around the people around them, "Are these all...?"
He stared, a hopeful group of civilians, and could only imagine how hard it must have been to make this trek.
"Yeah, we... we used to be bigger," Selkie said, his shoulders drooping, "but we're here. What... What about you?"
"I'm a part of a base a few miles from here," Gang Orca said. "Give me a second to contact HQ." His hand came up to his commlink.
While the others whispered to each other, marveling at how well equipped  

-

"...You know, I hate my pops too," Dabi said, leaning against the wall and not staring at Midoriya's face.
Midoriya, rummaging through the pockets of the dead man, didn't respond.
"So, like, we finally have something in common, you know?"
Midoriya picked the wallets out, pocketing the IDs and then dropped the wallet back onto the body's chest. He stood up and turned to Dabi.
He straightened, eyes bright in interest, and Midoriya left the room instead. 

-

"I can kill him, if you want," Shigaraki mentioned off-handedly, "Your dad."
Midoriya stopped where he was grabbing the pail of water, tipped his head back and sighed loudly.
"Then we'll be matching. Since I killed my dad too."
A shelf away, where Tamaki and Nejire were collecting the other pots to start sprouts, sudden coughing was heard. 
"You know, Dabi offered something very similar to that," he said, "Maybe the two of you have more in common than me."
Shigarki gave a fierce scowl, as he always did when Dabi was mentioned. 
"Go talk to him about it. Maybe you'll even become friends."
"I don't wanna be friends with that shithead."
Midoriya took a deep breath, and with what he had, left. Holding the spades that Midoriya handed him earlier, Shigaraki trailed behind him.

### [ Until We Bleed ]
>> au where AFO wins and the world is a well-crafted puppet show
>> OFA sneaking around to pass on a Possibility and a Hope that people fight for freedom
>> quiet, just because we 'free' the world, doesn't mean it'll be a good thing
>> Enji is #1 Hero. Expects his kids to grow up and be strong like him, but also doesn't really care
>> Dabi & "This bird cage. Let's destroy it."
>> Hawks & "What's wrong with this bird cage? People can choose what they want to grow up to be. We have a choice in making money or doing drugs, falling in love and chasing our dreams, what more do you want? What more freedom do you need?!"

>>whole-ass world is coming for Eri, the Time-Traveler, and Midoriya, her Protector & Hero
>> AFO doesn't have a time-quirk. Really wants her.

In theory, the longest she's ever spent time with Midoriya was six months. It was the first time, in that first timeline, when she didn't realize that she counted in the beautiful future that Midoriya talked about, where eveyone could be happy, as one of the [everyone].
Meaning, after meeting her, the longest Midoriya ever lived was six months. She had never seen him under the blistering sun, and she had never seen him under blooming cherry blossoms. Midoriya had never made it past his second year of high school.
Eri took that from him. It was like the whole world was mocking her relentlessly. Dangling her hero, the only person that heard her when she asked for help, in front of her with a mocking grin, asking.
"Don't you want to save him?"
And always, always, always, she agreed. 
Stupid, right? Or maybe crazy was the better phrase. Because crazy was used for people who kept doing the same thing while expecting different results.
But what did that make Midoriya Izuku, who always saved her? 

-

"You can't!" Eri shouted out because she would recognize that mess of scars anywhere. "You can't do it! No!" She yanked on Midoriya's hair and bit down on his shoulder. "No!"
"What? Ow! Eri-"
And even if it hurts a little now, it would be better than him dying-
But eventually, her uselessly weak body tired and she stopped kicking him as hard and her grip on him loosened. With fresh bite marks and a bleeding scratch on his already bruised face, Midoriya gently placed her on the ground. He rubbed the side of his neck, and the guilt crept up to her neck.
"Why do you always save him? He's just going to betray you."
"...Just because you save someone doesn't mean they owe you anything," Midoriya explained to her gently. "I wanted to save him, so I'm going to."
"I don't want you to," she said, her hand clutching onto his pants leg. "Please don't go."
He grabbed her hand, gentle and warm and alive, and her eyes started to water again. She liked this temperature for him, not that charred mess that Dabi always left him in whenever he got involved.
"I don't want you to get hurt."
And Midoriya, her exhausted hero who always looked like he was on the verge of breaking and crumbling down, gave her this smile. She knew this smile. It was the smile he gave her whenever it was time for them to say goodbye.
She hated this smile. 
"No, no," she cried, "I only had you for a week. It's not fair, it's not fair!"
Midoriya, hands warm and gentle like sunlight, held her hand. Despite all her thrashing, she was still careful not to break his grip.
"Why..." she cried, "why do you have to save him?"
Midoriya looked from Endeavor's eldest son, laying passed-out on the ground, and then back to Eri.
"Because I want to."
Her eyes watered, because that was the same reason why he saved her, too.

-

She just couldn't figure it out. Why did her Hero Deku save her, at that time, such a long time ago?
What Eri didn't realize was that she didn't need to prove to Midoriya that she wasn't lying and that she deserved to be saved. The fact that she asked Midoriya to save her was enough.
For Midoriya, the fact that someone needed, wanted, to be saved was enough for him to march into the maws of hell. 
Because that was the kind of hero that he was.

-

"I see," Midoriya nodded his head, crouching down in front of her as he gave a warm smile, "You're the one who saved me, then, aren't you?"
"No!" she screamed back. "No, I didn't!" Her tiny hands gripped tightly, and not for the first time, she desperately wished that she wasn't a child and that she was big and strong enough that she could just shake Midoriya and make him see the truth, "No, I never got to save you!"
He laughed, a breathless sound like he was too tired to laugh and she never wanted this, as his hand came onto her hair. Gently, too gentle for Eri to break away from, he pulled her into a hug.
"Sorry, Eri," he said, "You're probably tired of this too."
"No, no," she said, shaking her head, "Don't go. Please don't go. Please. Let's run away. Don't be a hero."
He grinned, not that uncertain grin he pulls on when he's trying to save someone but he's scared, but a grin filled with hope that Eri couldn't see.
"Let's go together."
"Eri, thank you for coming to save me."
"Stop," she blubbered out, tears streaming down her face, "Please stop."
"I'm sorry, please come and save me again."
Of course she would. 
This time, Midoriya's brain was splattered across her pink dress before she felt her soul rip out of her body and she was down the River of Time on a boat made of her agonized screams and his gentle smiles.

-

What was the Right Thing to do? 
Hawks stared at the tiny child holding a tinier child in his arms.
Why did he become a hero?
"...Hawks-san," the culprit said, voice quiet. "...I suppose you won't let us go, right?"
"...If you turn yourselves in, I can argue to give you a lighter sentence," Hawks explained, as he always did. "I swear to you that I will do something for you."
"If I turn myself in," Midoriya said, "Can you quit being a hero and take care of Eri until she can protect herself?"
The blond blinked.
"Because to be honest, I don't mind going to prison. And I don't mind if this is the end of my life as I know it. Not all Heroes get paid, but all heroes face consequences, right?"
His grin 

-

If Stain had to pinpoint a singular moment, he would say that the Beginning of the End actually wasn't Midoriya Izuku.
It was actually his mother.
Yes, if it wasn't for Midoriya Inko, Stain wouldn't have ever gotten involved. When shit hit the fan, he would have tuckered down and remained carefully hidden until the perfect opportunity where he could make his return, cleaning society.
And if Stain was an irresponsible person 

"Here."
Stain stared in shock, because how did this lady even find him, again? He's been dodging the police, heroes, other villains, and that one hitman-group for fucking years, but this domestic housewife has found him, twice in a single week.
"I... I can get more."
And he blanched at the duffel bag between them.
"Lady, I'm not a hitman," he said.
"You're a hero-killer, aren't you?" she replied back.
He clicked his jaw shut because, "Didn't you want me to save your kid?"
"No, you're not a hero," she said, and at least she understood that. "But you're the Hero Killer. Can't you at least make it easier for my son?"
Stain looked at the bag of money, because what the fuck? Where did people like this even come from? He didn't get it, he didn't understand, but he did think that it was a waste that she was just a domestic housewife. She would have been unstoppable, the same way she's been hunting down poeple with specific skillsets to try and save her son. 
"I can get more money."
He stared at the bag.
"The money isn't the issue."
"My son is a hero," she said, "In case you need to send him too."
And he wished that he had any idea what the hell went through a mother's head.

-

Stain met Midoriya, the child the domestic housewife tried to hire a hitman for.
Standing over the Hero that was just trying to capture him, Hitman Target stared at Stain.
"...I guess if I ask you to let him go, you won't, right?"
Stain drew his blade. 
"If you understand that, stand aside. I don't want to stain my blade with any blood that isn't a hero's."
"

"I'm the Hero-Killer Stain," Stain said, "I only go after those fakes."
"I'm... as fake as they get," the Hitman Target said, nervous smile and and a bleeding cut. "I can't save anyone."
His voice broke, his knees trembled, he looked like he hadn't slept in days and he was in a desperate need of a shower. Looking at him, Stain would think that the kid was a runaway or something. 
"Then give up, and stand down."
"No way," Hitman Target said, swaying on his feet, "Then I'd never be able to be a hero."
A hero, Stain suddenly realized, was someone that couldn't come up to his chest, with soft green eyes and a frightened smile standing on the other side of his blade.
"Because a Hero is someone stands up because someone else can't."
The Hero-Killer met Midoriya Izuku, and started the end of his career.
