### kind nightmare

Aizawa frowned. "Midoriya," he said, hating the fact that he couldn't even let th kid rest properly, but this was beyond his control so, "the lights aren't coming on," he said, and as the words came out of his mouth, Midoriya shot up.
The young man flinched, no doubt from proof of their passionate session, and his hand reached for his phone.
"Oh no," he gasped before his head fell to the pillow. "I-I'm really sorry, Aizawa-sensei. I-"
"Midoriya, just tell me what's going on."
His student sucked his cheeks in. He looked down at his hands, his face contorting into a pained expression, and Aizawa suppressed the urge to lean in and kiss those worries away. First, he needed to know what these worries were. 
"I... I didn't pay for the electriciy," Midoriya said, ashamed but honest. "I-I'm really sorry for the trouble. I... I was irresponsible and-"
"Midoriya, have you been paying your own bills?"
He thought about it. He had noticed that one of the shelves of All Might Merchanise was completely cleared out. He had been privately relieved that there was less All Might Memorabilla, but now, he felt sick. 
Hadn't enough been taken from Midoriya already? 
"Isn't that funny?" Midoriya asked, "We're training to be heroes. To become people that can protect other people and help police enforce justice." He covered his face, "But I can't even pay for electricity." 
"This... really shouldn't be your concern."
"Then, if I pretend that it's not and I pretend that it's not happening, will my electricity magically return?"
Aizawa's eyes widened, and Midoriya, understanding what he said, turned to him in shock.
"I... I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to say that aloud. You-You're right, there's nothing worth complaining about here. I should be working on finding a solution-"
"Midoriya," Aizawa's hands came to his shoulder. "I'm sorry," he said, because someone needed to tell him that he shouldn't need to sacrifice his joy to see tomorrow, and that it wasn't his fault that no one saw and no one noticed. "I should have noticed and reached out sooner."
Midoriya's head shot up and he shook his head. "No, it's okay. I-I need to be responsible anyways."
And Aizawa winced. When a child learned of responsibility, it meant that an adult had failed them. While it would be impossible to save everyone, and Aizawa was aware of that, he really wanted to do right by Midoriya. 
But he also knew Midoriya. Even if he didn't need to, he wanted to work for every last bit of aspect of his life. It was as inspiring as it was exhausting to watch. But this, Aizawa could do this.
"...There are some scholarship opportunities," he said, "that UA offers students who might need financial support. After all, if you're worried about the lights in your place, then you won't be worried about being a better hero." He tapped the wall, "When I tell you that you can rely on me, I mean that I can share information with you that you wouldn't have known about otherwise."
Which was bullshit, and he didn't care if he ended up paying for this "scholarship" out of pocket, he was going to do this for the hero that reminded him of the hero that he admired the most growing up. 
"R-Really?" Midoriya said.
Hopefully, and Aizawa was not a man of fate but he was about to start praying, Midoriya would finally believe him enough to share his troubles with him. 
"Yeah," Aizawa nodded. "We can't do everything by ourselves, Midoriya. That's true for adults, children, heroes and civilians." He gave him a crooked smile, and tried not to lose it when he saw the relieved slump of his shoulders.

-

Luckily, there were really scholarships for that kind of thing.
"...Midoriya-kun hasn't filed for a missing person report?" Nezu asked.
Aizawa thought about the closet, and shook his head. "He ... He doesn't think she's 'missing'."
Nezu frowned, "I see. Perhaps you could tell him that being 'missing' could help her re-integrate in society and recieve the help she needs, therapy and taxes and all, if she would like it." 
Aizawa nodded. Regardless of any personal feelings, it was a valid point. If Midoriya was missing the obvious bills, he had no doubt that their financial situation, credit scores and all, must be an uncontrollable maelstorm. The fact that Aizawa hadn't even thought of it had his stomach twisting. 
While he fucked Midoriya into the mattress with soft words and gentle promises, had Midoriya been concerned about the monsters in the closet, his grades, and where his next meal was coming from? And still, he could smile at his homeroom teacher and apologize for his shortcomings?
"I'll get on that," Aizawa said.
"I see. Is that also why you, Kan, Yamada, and Inui are engaging in inapropiate student-teacher conduct?"
Aizawa choked. He whipped around he gritted his teeth and tried to find the right thing to say. 
"I don't care what you do in your free time," he said honestly. "However, I do hope that you are supporting Midoriya, instead of being supported by him." The principal stared right at him, "Or else I will need to step in."
Although that icy touch of fear gripped his heart tightly, he still managed to feel grateful.
Because essentially, Nezu gave his word that he would keep an eye on Midoriya. He felt like Midoriya could use that kind of support.
"...Thank you," he said. 
Nezu smiled back and waved, "Please don't start a scandal. It would ruin Midoriya's career before it starts."
"Understood."
For now, they can say that the teachers are stepping in because Midoriya was missing his mother. When Midoriya's mother returned, he supposed he would have to do something else entirely. 
Starting with an apology. And then following up with a promise.

-

Midoriya woke up slowly, a yawn ripping through his throat, and when he sat up, realized there was an arm over his waist. Vaguely, he remembered sleeping alone. He looked to where Aizawa slept, half curled around him like a large cat, and his arm tightened around Midoriya's waist.
"It's Sunday," he murmured, eyebrows furrowed and clenching his eyes shut. "Sleep in." 


-

"Twice," Midoriya smiled and Twice froze in the doorway, "Welcome back! The lady next door said she made too much for dinner so we're eating fried rice. Go wash your hands and let's eat together."
The man stared at him for a long, long moment before the tears came streaming down his face.
Midoriya jolted and rushed forward, "Twice-"
The man covered his face and turned away, and Midoriya stopped an arm's distance away from him.
"I'm fine," he said, voice croaking. He took a shaky step forward and wrapped his arms around the young man. He sniffled loudly. "I'm fine now."
Midoriya felt his shoulder soak, and wrapped his arms around the older man. Quietly, he wondered if there was a way to save him.
"Hard day at work?" he hoped not, because he felt like Twice deserved a little bit of slack. Just enough to let him rest and reorient himself.
"I'm okay," Twice said, arms tight around his waist as he trembled with every breath.

### villain academia 

-

"Yes," and Iida's bright demeanor finally dimmed because, "So I have been held back for three years."
Midoriya's eyebrows hit his hairline.
"Th... three years?" he asked. 
Iida pinched the brdige of his nose and sniffled. "Excuse me," he said, voice trembling.
And regardless of how Midoriya felt, seeing Iida like this made his heart ache. He grabbed the man's hand, and gave a small smile.
"It's okay, Iida-kun," he said. "Let's move up another year together."
Iida turned to him, eyes bright and shining. Unshed tears looked up at him, and Midoriya gave him a helpless smile. For a student at Villain Academia, he looked so hopeful.

-

"According to this," Midoriya said, reading from his note summary, "It says that merit points are given based on the number of rules that are broken."
The problem was, he supposed, that they had to be caught breaking the rules. In that case, the easiest way to advance would be to not show up to class. Assuming that their homeroom teacher took attendence, they would be noticed for breaking the rules.
Demerit points would be granted to students who did exceptionally well. He supposed rule-breakers like Iida-kun. He looked at his friend, who nodded seriously as he solved problems from his textbook.
"Iida-kun," he said, "could I check your ID?"
By scanning a student's ID in their school app, it was easy to check where a student standing was.
"Yes, of course," Iida handed it over, as trusting as always. He gave a shy smile. "I... I'm afraid that my record isn't very impressive." 
Midoriya smiled back, because Iida-kun was a good person. The person that came so gallantly to help him pick up his books was someone with compassion and a gentle heart made up of hard-work and empathy. 
"We need to first figure out where we start," Midoriya reminded him, a smile on his face, "But if you don't feel comfortable with it, that's okay, too." He nodded his head, "I want to earn that trust."
Iida stared at him before his gaze dropped to his lap. He sniffled loudly, again. Lifting his glasses with one hand, he brought the other hand up and squeezed the bridge of his nose. He took a deep breath, and then turned back to Midoriya with a watery smile.
"Midoriya-kun, I'm so lucky to have met you."
Thinking of it like this, it was easy for Midoriya to sabotage this man. 
"If you trust me, you're also trusting me not to sabotage you," he said, unable to help himself.
"But Midoriya-kun, doesn't it also mean that I don't mind if you betray me?"
Midoriya felt his heart squeeze. 
Iida passed him his Student ID, a heartening smile on his face. 
Midoriya stared at it for a moment before he pulled his wallet out and pulled his ID out too. He handed it over to Iida.
"Me too, Iida-kun," he said. "I don't mind being betrayed by you."
The light that entered Iida's eyes was brighter than anything he could have imagined. It made Midoriya straighten and smile back, feeling as though he could take on the world. 
With their ID's exchanged, Midoriya scanned Iida's ID and blanched at the number of demerits he had. Come to think of it, it was obvious that, since Iida had attented this school for so long, he would have a large number of demerits. But still... 
There were so many zeroes behind that nine. He pursed his lips and looked back at Iida and his sheepish expression. 
This... might be more serious than he thought. 

-

"I..." Midoriya hestiated. "Wait, he's been in your class for three years?"
Aizawa sucked on the cigarette, dark bags under his eyes as he scowled. 
"Yep."
Midoriya did the math.
"You've been teaching since you were ten?"
Aizawa's grin, full of malicious energy and biting confidence, stretched into something dangerous.
