### Way Back Home 

["this isn't your world"]
Midoriya woke up, tears streaming from his eyes. He sat up, fingers coming up to his eyes and he took a deep breath.
Today too, he was in the wrong place.

### withering

"I think we should stop meeting like this."
His eyes were sharp. If Midoriya reached for him, he might get cut. He stared up at the man, caked in grime and tense like he was expecting to be hit, and smiled back.
"It's dirty here," he said, "You want to get some dinner? I walked by this taiyaki stall, and now I really want to eat it."
The stranger was quiet for a second longer.

"So, do you have my jacket?" Midoriya asked quietly, "I'd like it back."
"I threw it away," the blond said, eyes forward.
"Damn," Midoriya said, but it didn't bother him as much as he thought it would.
"You're... not upset?"
And Midoriya, whose heart might stop at any given second if he just breathed too hard, laughed back. 
"Why would I be?" he asked, "I'd rather see you again than a jacket."
"We only met once," the blond said, his expression soured as his face twisted into a frown. "It wasn't even a real meeting! You didn't have to give me anything! I was fine without you! I never needed you! I don't need anyone! I have myself! I can take care of it!" He stood up, his voice echoing in the hotel room they were in. His chest heaved with his breaths. 
Green eyes widened, not expecting the outburst. He stared for a moment longer, and he took a step closer to the man. Concerned eyes peered up at him.
"Yeah, I know."
"You... know?"
"The person that reached out was me," he said, "I'm glad that you're okay."
"You are?"
Midoriya's expression turned a little more certain.
"I'm glad that my efforts weren't needed," he said. He lifted the pizza pamplet up, "Do you want breadsticks or cheesesticks?"
"Cheesesticks, duh. // Breadsticks are for poor people!"
The blond slapped his hand over his mouth. For a moment he looked incredibly fearful, as his eyes darted from Midoriya to the ground and all his features paled immensely. He clamped his hand down against his lips.
"I like cheesesticks too," Midoriya said, "but I also like breadsticks so it was a tough decision for me." He smiled back, "Lucky me."
The blond stared at him for another moment. His hand dropped from his mouth and fat tears ran down his face. When his knees wobbled and gave out underneath him, Midoriya rushed forward to grab the man. He was heavier than he looked, but and they ended up just sinking to the ground. Arms thick like branched wove around Midoriya and seemed to turn to stone. The man gave these agonized cries, giving up on hiding and being quiet to open his mouth and sob. Probably because Midoriya had spent so long in and out of the hospital, watching pepole recieve a certain type of news, he didn't feel anything. Placing his hand onto his back, rubbing soothing circles, he did as was always required of him when he was caught in these positions. His shirt soaked considerably, and it made him cold, but the burning furnace of the man clutching him made it certain that Midoriya wasn't going to get personal space anytime soon.
"I'm here," he said, not for long, but in the moment. "It's alright. I'm here with you."
Evenutally, he would learn that this was Jin, a man who could [double] anything. He could double just about anything, yet with all his clones and copies, he had never had someone tell him that they were there for him.

-

"Augh, I haven't ever cried like that," he sniffled loudly. He wiped at his face roughly with his arm, when Midoriya's hand came to his arm. "Huh?"
"Here, this will feel better," Midoriya said, passing him a tissue. "Or just wash your face."
The blond pushed his face closer, "Do it for me," he said. 
With a sigh Midoriya got up. Grabbing one of the smaller dishcloths, he ran warm water over it and wrung the water out. With a little hum, he returned and kneeled down in front of the larger man. It was weird, to think that he would be the one that would be taking care of someone else. Gently as he could, he pressed the towel against his blotched face.
He paused when he saw the look on his face. Tilting his head to the side, he pressed the towel to his own face.
"Is it too hot?" he muttered.
"Why are you doing this?"
Midoriya arched an eyebrow at him, "I thought you wanted me to do this."
"That doesn't mean that you have to."
"Yeah, but there's no reason why I can't either."
"I..."
He looked so helplessly lost.
"I don't get it," he said at last.
"It means we're friends," Midoriya said, wondering how this man could live double his projected lifespan and spent his entire life not understanding what that meant.
"I don't even know your name."
"Midoriya," he said, and because he's always wanted to hear it from someone else's mouth, "but my friends call me Izuku."
The blond said. "Haha... I never thought I'd make a friend."
He grabbed Izuku's hands, pulling them to his face.
"Jin," he said, closing his eyes. "I want my friend to call me Jin."

-

"...I don't recommend staying with him," Eraserhead said. 
"I didn't realize I had a choice in the matter," Midoriya replied back bluntly, "It's not like I call him up and ask him if he's free for lunch, after all."
The older man scowled. Clicking his tongue, he cuffed the younger man by the back of his head. 
"Don't be so cheeky."
"

### sick & tired

Summary: "Following reasons and theory and fate sounds boring," Twice said, "Just do what you want to do."

No doubt, Twice must have led a life full of freedom. 
Izuku stared at him for a moment, eyes wide as he took in the wide grin on his face, the heartfelt words, before a laugh came from his lips. 
"...Keep up," Izuku said, stepping on the ledge with a grin on his face. 
Twice beamed back, barely half a step behind Izuku when the building shattered and the two stepped off.

### rotting flowers

"You want to be free, right?" Midoriya asked, eyes gentle. "It's alright. I don't blame you."
He looked at the assailant, he looked young.
Death by stabbing. It wasn't the worst way to go, and all things considered, this was probably bettter. 
"Get out of here quickly," he said. "Or else you will face a life worse than death."
"Why... Why are you letting me go?"
"When we're hurt, we hurt others. It's alright. I don't blame you. So run away and forget all of this."

### returning a gift

"Listen to me, Kouta," Jin said, grabbing the young man by the shouders, and kneeled in front of him. "And listen very closely, okay? We're bad people. So when bad things happen to us, no one cares and a lot of people are hoping that bad things happen to us."
Kouta nodded, gravely.
The blond smiled back, an expression that Kouta hadn't learned was too bright for their part of the world, before he continued.
"And it's okay be a bad person. If you kill someone or if you steal something or you do some cocaine or kidnap someone you like, it's okay. We're still family."
Kouta's eyes shined.
"But there's one thing we don't do."
"...One thing?" 
"Yeah," the older man pointed at the street, "You don't cross alone."
Kouta blanked. "What?"
Jin reached out to him, large hand extended out in a way that didn't make sense against his bloodstained suit, and he gave the young child a beaming grin.
"C'mon, let's go."
Numbly, as though dazzled by that radiance, Kouta took his hand.
"Man, that could have been bad," the blond said.
"Really?"
"Yeah, people can die because of this," Jin nodded along, squeezing Kouta's hand tightly. "And we don't want family to die."
Even though there was no reason to, because Kouta's parents died a long time ago and he was a big boy who wasn't affected by these kinds of anymore, his eyes watered. He wondered how different things would have been if his parents thought that too.
Walking hand in hand with Jin, he wouldn't realize that Jin was shortening his steps to match his for years to come.

-

"You good?"
"...The meeting fell through," Midoriya said as he stubbed the end of his cigarette into the ashtray. He reached to grab another cigarette from his case, and realizing it was empty, gave a long sigh. He reached into his pocket, and remembering something, covered his face with his hands. "Twice, you got a cig?" he yelled out.
"Twice is out. Getting stomach medicine for Shigaraki," Dabi said, eyebrows furrowed and a growing frown on his lips. It spelled bad things if Midoriya had forgotten where his people were, for any reason. He came next to him, "I'll grab some for you. Give me ten minutes-"
"Dabi," Midoriya's voice was cold, but his smile looked the same as it always was, "Don't leave my side."
A shiver ran down Dabi's side as he tipped his head to his side.
"I can do that for you."
"And get me a drink," he said, fiddling with the empty box. 
"Yes sir," he called out lazily, going to their little kitchen area to grab drinks. He stared at the fridge, the only thing in there were the milk for the coffee, some creamer, half a cake, three apples, Mitsuji's fingers, Twice's coffee from four days ago (it's starting to turn green) and some orange juice. Easy choice. He grabbed the orange juice, two cups, and headed out. Obviously, in their other fridge, there was a plethora of different alcohols, but Dabi had a good idea on what Midoriya wanted right now.

### until we bleed

"Do you know how many of our he's killed?!" Eraserhead shouted out, "You think that he'll magically turn around and change just because you asked him to? You remember to say 'please' and 'thank you' when he turnes around to burn all of this down!?"
Midoriya didn't even flinct. Staring at him for a long moment, he waited.
The hand reached out to grab him by the front of his shirt and shook him. 
"What's your excuse, Deku?! Who did you hate so fucking much that you didn't mind endangering all of us?!"
"I didn't want to kill him," Midoriya said. 
Aside from the fact that everyone that he killed would be someone he killed because of Eri, he didn't think the young girl needed anymore blood on her hands.
"What did you say?"
But Midoriya also wasn't someone who had no idea what he wanted to be. From before Eri, he had already dug his heels into the ground and made a choice. 
"I didn't want to kill him. So I didn't."
Eraserhead's gaze was cold.
"And you didn't turn him in because-"
"I knew someone would kill him. If I lead him to his death, I still killed him."
From behind, Present Mic stood up. He knew that Midnight was one of the ones that was lost to Dabi's fire but.
"And by letting him go, all the people that he kills after this are also on him."
Midoriya's heart twisted at the reminder.
"And all the people that he saves will also be mine."
There was nothing these people could do to him that would make him hurt as much as they did. He knew that, and still, he...
"You blithering idiot. There's no room for heroes in this world."
And Midoriya almost smiled back, because he knew that was wrong. After all, in the other room sat Eri, the smallest Hero he's known.

-

"I'm sorry for what I said before. That there are no room for heroes in this world."
The realization strucked Midoriya and he shook his head, "...No, no. It's okay, you don't have to-"
Aizawa's laugh, the first one he's ever heard from him, was a sudden sound like a bomb had gone off. It stopped Midoriya cold, as it felt like he had never seen this man before. Was Aizawa someone who would look so young, just from smiling that widely. 
His hand came up to his head, ruffling his hair just the slightest bit. "Go save that girl," he said, "She's waiting for you."
Without another word, Aizawa shoved Midoriya out of the window. Laughter carrying on the skies, the last thing Midoriya saw was Aizawa's wide grin before the entire floor exploded. When Midoriya crashed into the water, nothing seemed to hurt more than his heart. 
And the sound that he heard Yamada make when he gave his report, wasn't something he would ever forget.

-

"I..." Yamada gave a rasping gasp, blood splattering out of his mouth, "I thought... thought Shota died for nothing-"
"Stop speaking!" Midoriya snapped back, and the blond laughed. 
"You yelll... now?"
Midoriya, hands soaked as he tried to stop the damned bleeding, wished that Yamada still hated him, would always hate him, would never forgive him, if it meant that the man would survive this. 
"B-but you know," Yamada's hand, missing two fingers and a chunk of his forearm managed to get to Midoriya's face, "I-I think I get it-"
His words came out like fast-changing currents. A few words punctuated by breaths and then his blood sprays and Midoriya tried his best not to cry.
"Stop talking," he said, eyes blurring with his tears, "We're getting you out of here. We're-"
The back of his index finger managed to run along under his eye, as though to wipe his tears. The strangled sob wrangled inside of Midoriya's throat.
"...Glad... you're okay..." he wheezed out. "Little... Eri," he gasped out, "Take care, okay?"
Yamada died, just like Aizawa did, with a grin that made him look as though he's never knew hurt.
Unlike when Aizawa died though, Midoriya was the one that screamed until his voice faded.


### 1+2

Rex yawned, rubbed the back of his neck, and without even mentioning anything, Akhos draped a blanket over his shoulder. Kissing the top of his head, he gave his Driver a charming smile. Rex, cheeks red, nodded his thanks and pulled the blanket a little tighter around him.
"The water is still boiling," Akhos said, "but it'll be out soon."
"Oh, that would be great. Thank you." 
Akhos' hand came to ruffle his hair for a second before he pulled away, "Alright, then I'll see you in a bit." He walked out, a spring in his step and a grin on his face.
"Mehmeh!" Tora whined, "it's not fair!"
Rex sniffled as he scowled at his friend. "Yeah, yeah, I want to go back to bed and sleep this cold away too," he replied back, nasal and otherwise stuffy. His voice was scratchy as he gave a sigh, "Hey Tora, can this wait till I'm better?"
"Aniki, it's not fair. Tora do good work, too! Tora work need help, too!"
Rex shivered, and pulled the blanket back over himself. He tilted his head to the side and imagined what it would be like to lay in bed. Behind him, Akhos was rushing in with two cups of hot tea. 
"But Rex has three, right? Can't Tora have one?"
"...Tora, they're their own person. Go talk to them if you want something like that-"
"Mehmeh! They won't leave you!"
Rex covered his mouth to cover his pleased smile. Quickly recovering his expression, he took a deep breath and leaned back in his seat.
"There's your answer then-"
"But it's not fair!"
"Tora, what do you want me to do about it?!"
"I want one! I want a Blade, too!"
"Oi, Tora-"
"It's fine," Akhos said, placing a steaming cup of hot tea on the table. "There's plenty of core crystals around the area," he added, "so we just need to find one for Tora, right? If he really has what it takes, a Blade should answer his call."
"...Hey-"
"Really?" Tora all but leapt to his feet, and with a smile sweet like honey, Akhos nodded. "Rex! Get better quickly and we'll go!"
And he was out the door.
Rex gave several miserably coughs before he placed his head on the ground. 
"This isn't going to go well, is it?" he asked. The cool of the table felt good against his head, but his body shivered again.
"It will. I'll ensure it," Akhos replied. Warm hands came to Rex's shoulders and pulled him back. "Drink some tea," he said, "and then go sleep." He flashed his pearly whites at him, "Leave the rest to me!"
"How reliable," Rex mumured out. His hands came to take the hot cup of tea. He blew on it slowly and took a sip. The hot liquid came spilling into him and warmed him from the inside out. "It's good," he said.
Akhos beamed back. He puffed his chest out and leaned back, pushing his glasses up higher on his face as he laughed brightly.
"Right?! I took some liberties with the recipe that Lady Corinne left behind, in consideration for your personal tastes! I knew that you would like it!" he gave a boisterous laugh and Rex continued to drink the tea. 
"Do you really mean it? That Tora could become a Driver?"
"If he has the capabilities for it, I don't doubt it," Akhos replied back, crossing is arms over his chest as he leaned against the chair next to Rex. "And it'll get him off your back about this." He stared at Rex contemplatively, "You don't think he'll make a good Driver?"
"Nah, he'll be fine. He'll treasure the Blade he gets, but..."
"But?"
"I don't like how he refers to them. You guys aren't status markers. You have your own thoughts and feelings. I just hope he doesn't forget that."
Akhos stared at Rex and gave a small smile, "You know, there's plenty of people that would disagree with you."
"Augh," Rex shook his head. He placed his empty mug on the table and shook his head, "If any of them show their face here, we're beating the shit out of them."
And even though this wasn't the first time, Akhos felt that protective warmth curl around his chest. Placing his hand on top of Rex's head, he ruffled his hair gently. When the young man lifted his arm to get his hand out of his hair, their eyes met, and Akhos wondered if his Driver could feel the way he did right now.
Shame, if only Rex wasn't sick...
He leaned in to kiss his head once more.
