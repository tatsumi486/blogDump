### SAT
Izuku paused, and placed his pen down. As though sensing the change in the mood, the room quickly fell into silence.
"Since when were we a democracy?" he asked. He placed his hand on the papers and stood up. He gave Aizawa a pointed look, "Organize supplies," and then he turned to Spinner, "Organize weapons." He grabbed his planner, "Tell Yamada to keep it up with the daily announcements, and Brava to keep an ear for other broadcasts. Fatgum, we're going to clean out the West-side. Be ready in thirty minutes."
"Yes sir," the others stood up, ready to go as commanded. 
"W-What?"
"If you're dissatisfied," Izuku said, a smile twisting his lips, "Leave."
And from the silence in the room, it was clear where they all stood about this matter. 
Izuku left without another word, and the man spluttered back. 

-

Izuku clutched the basket as he dry-heaved into it. To think that he would become the person that he hated the most. The kind of person that would dismiss people as he saw them just because they didn't fit his perfect view of the world. His stomach coiled, and he couldn't tell if he was laughing or crying. 
Villains didn't get saved. By that logic, he must be a villain. Of course, that's also false since he was just an omega. Omega's, soft and squishy, existed to be accessories. So really, he was just waiting to be put down. 
Who would get to him first? The monsters outside or the humans inside? 
He couldn't wait to find out. 

-

"You know they hate me," Izuku said, "If you do this, you'll make an enemy out of them too."
"Izuku, there are two types of people in the world," Chisaki explained, "your current enemies, and your future enemies."
"Really?"
The older man smiled back. "Something like that."
"then, what does that make me?"
"My current enemy," Chisaki replied back, "And the only one I'll concede defeat to."
Izuku wondered, if he was born an alpha, would he look that happy to lose, too? 



### Returning A Gift 

"So if you're so great, why did Izuku hire people after you?" Shigaraki asked.
And an inferno reupted where his heart should be as Dabi turned to glare. Who the hell was this bastard to call him by his first name?
"He's stupid," Dabi replied, because why would anyone hire him to begin with? Hire both of them? Obviously, they were missing some congnitive process. 

-

"It's alright. You don't have to take this on yourself anymore."
"...Yagi-san," Midoriya asked, lighting a cigarette and taking a quiet puff. Next to him, the older man backed away from him. "Do you think that you could have killed AFO by yourself?" he asked.
Aizawa felt his breath catch his in throat.
"No matter how I think about it, I can't imagine it either. And even if you did win, I didn't think you would have come out in one piece." He took a deep drag of the cigarette, looking much too old for the gakuren he was in. "Ah, I'm not trying to make any knocks on you, sir!" he said, voice bright and earnest in a way only a child could be. He turned to the larger man, eyes worried, "I am grateful for everything that you've done. I know that the peace I experienced was only because of your hard work and sacrifice."
The words sounded mocking, however, given the bruises on his neck and face. It sounded to even Aizawa, and the man was eavesdropping on a conversation between a pair of strangers.
"Shounen..."
"So you don't have to be upset, or anything," the young man said. "No one would be able to trace from me to you."
With that, he passed over a usb to Yagi.
"I will do what I can. To the best of my ability, so please," he pushed the files to Yagi. When the older man opened his hand, he placed it into his massive hands. Wrapping his small hands around the Hero's, it felt laughable how small the child. "Please save them."
Aizawa heard too much. In his head, it made sense, and he understood. 
The Era of Peace was built on top of the backs of many others.

-

"Yagi-san," Aizawa said, approaching the older man, "About that informat-"
And Yagi's massive hands came to his shoulders instantly with a harsh grip. Blue eyes, so bright that they were glowing, trained on Aizawa. 
"And Izuku-shounen? Is he okay?"
In his chest, his heart pinched. His questions died in his throat, there was no doubt, Yagi had no idea. 
"...I haven't seen him in a while," he lied, "I was wondering if you had any ideas."
And All Might, Symbol of Peace, sagged his shoulders. His hands dropped to his side.
"I-I see. Sorry about that." He cleared his throat and straightened out. "Unforutately, I haven't seen him recently either. Is everything alright?"
Aizawa nodded, "Just wanted to inform him that the case was closed."
The blond laughed, a sound too quiet for a man his size, and he looked out the window.
"Yes, I'm sure that he would love to hear about that."
Aizawa couldn't help but think that he learned too much about this man recently. 

-

Eri was powerful. Eri was powerful, and her eyes shined when she got to eat something sweet and pouted when she was told to eat her vegetables. She came up to his hip now, growing up so fast, and loved reading about myths and history. 

"I'm not looking to save every little girl in the world!" Midoriya shouted out, losing his temper, "I'm trying to save one!"
And in Midoriya's mind, that translated to becoming unfathomably powerful. Then, he would be able to keep what was preicous to him safe. He would be able to have eyes and ears everywhere. He would be able to keep this one girl's smile untainted and beautiful.
And if he could do it, then he thought that his life would have been worth living. That there would be a point to it. 

-

"...Good evening, Hawks-san," Midoriya greeted amiably. 
Hawks found it uncanny how sweet he could sound even though his hands were still coated in blood. Well, he supposed in that sense, they were very similar. 
"Evening? It's a bit early for that, is it?"
Midoriya smiled back, sweetly. He could hardly believe that this kid was the same age as Tokoyami. 
"I had a late night. My mind must have escaped me."

### Withering
"...Number Two should be able to do something about this," Dabi said quietly. 
Midoriya's hand grabbed his shirt. 
"Then you wouldn't be Dabi anymore."
And Dabi never thought it could be such a threat, but indeed, his heart sank in his chest.
"Then, should I just watch die?" his voice cracked.
Midoriya gave him a cheeky grin, "Demons don't grant easy deaths, remember?"
And occationally, Dabi wished that they never met. Then he'd never regret fighting for himself and he would never regret leaving that family. 
Midoriya's hand grabbed his, lacing their fingers together, and beamed up at him. Laughably weak. Mockingly small. 
Someone as small and as weak as Midoriya, but Dabi couldn't even protect him. Dabi reached his other arm to grab the young man and hold him close to his heart. 
He never cared about living a long life, but the time they had together felt too short. The universe must be laughing at him.

-

"Do you remember? When you asked me if I've been rejected before?"
Midoriya, delirious with a fever, managled to mumble something or another.
"If you reject me, I'll have an answer."
A cool towel came to his forehead.
"So get better already. Or else I'll murder someone."

-

Endeku -> train crash? they're stuck together for two days? enji can't use fire because cave-in crash & limited oxygen
-> enji's here to catch a train to do a public safety survey thing 
-> midoriya on his way home from the hospital (excused absense)
-> 10am pre-rush crash. Everyone says it good that it wasn't during rush-hour, but that didn't mean that no one was operating the trains
-> 48hrs with #2 Hero

-

"Stay," Enji said, his hand grabbing Midoriya's loosely. "Choose to stay with me."
Midoriya stared at him, and then tugged his hand back.
"I don't think that's a good idea," he said, "And it won't look good for you either." 
"There's a difference between looking good and being good," he said, "I think I get it now."
He brought his hand up to his chest, right over his heart, like he wanted Midoriya to feel his earnesty through his pulse.
"I want to show you," he said, "that your affections weren't wasted on a man like me."
At that, Midoriya laughed.
"It was never a waste," he said, "I didn't waste anything on you. There's nothing about that's a waste."
A watery laugh escaped his lips, and he hunched his back even more. Pressing Midoriya's knuckles to his head, he gave this limp laugh, like he thought he didn't deserve any bit of happiness that he got.
"Since meeting you, the things that I didn't struggle with has gotten so heavy," he said. "Yet, it's not a life that I wish to return to."
"You don't have to," Midoriya tried.
"Then stay."
The young man stared at him and shook his head. "I can't... I can't do that. I can't. You know why. If I choose you, it's not even just a few years. It might not even be six months. what... What does it matter? Can't we just keep going like this instead?"
"Even if it's just six months," Enji said, "I want to make you happy for the rest of your life." 
"Then what happens to you?" Midoriya asked.
And the man grinned back, dazzling and handsome, "I will experience a happiness unlike anything else for six months."
"That's too sad," the young man shook his head. "I don't want to do that to you. Can't you find someone else? Someone that would be with you and stay with you?"
"If you say yes," Enji replied, "I will have."
And Midoriya hated how his heart fluttered in his chest.
"We can't be happy," he said. 
And with eyes as gentle as gentle as the sea was expansive, Enji 

-

"Can you save him?!" Dabi yelled out, and Enji wondered if he knew how much he looked like Rei. "Just, just him. Can't you save him?"
He covered his face.
"Save him. And I'll turn myself in."
"...If you turn yourself in, you might never see him again," Enji reminded him.
"You won't break your word," Touya replied back. "You're awful. A real shitstain on the world. My life was miserable from the moment I was born because you were the one that I was born into. But you've always cared about being a Hero. Being a Hero matters to you."
He shook his head.
"Save him. I'll do whatever you want."

(and since Dabi's Endeavor's kid, they decided to pretend it never happened and rebranded him as Endeavor's secretary after a few yeras in prison. Except, by the time he came out, Izuku was already...)



### APOC

"Love at first sight?" Hawks tilted his head to the side and hummed, "Yeah, I think I get it."
Deku's hand grabbed his sleeve and he peered up at the older man. Hawks blinked, surprised but not unwecloming it. 
"What... does it mean?" he asked.
"It's when you meet someone for the first time and you fall in love with them. The way that they stand to the way the wind watches their clothes, the way that their lips move..." Hawks paused, and relaizingthat he was getting a little distracted, chuckled, "things like that. It gets stuck in your head."
Green eyes, so clear that Hawks could see his reflection, peered up at him.
"Have you experienced it?" he asked.
Hawks stared at him for a moment and then gave a huff.
"Yeah," he said, "something like it."

-

"Love at first sight?" Stain frowned, and everyone braced themselves for the disgust on his face and lecture they would get in return. "Of course it's real."
There was a long pause, and everyone turned to just stare at him.
"I'm sorry, but what?" Ingenium, who was walking by at the time, pushed the window all the way open. "One more time for the kids in the back, what?"
Stain frowned, like he didn't get why everyone was so hung up on this.
"None of you have anything better to do?" he growled out.
That got them packing and leaving. Except Ingenium, who perched his chin on his hand and stared at him with a frown.
"Huh, would have never pegged you as a romantic."
"Romance doesn't follow logic," Stain shrugged back, sheathing his blade. He gave him a crooked grin, "That's what makes it so exciting, right?"
A contemplative gleam crossed Ingenium's face before he broke out into laughter.

-

Stain rolled his eyes, he couldn't believe people were still stuck on this.
"Chizome?" 
"Love at first sight," the man said, red eyes focused completely on Deku, "it's real."
The owner of his Swords' Oath smiled back, a gaze so gentle that Stain couldn't believe he could stand so tall when the wind blew.
"I know," he replied, and Stain could feel his heart seize. 

-

"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

-

"There's been a misunderstanding," Chisaki clicked his tongue as he shook his head, "This base stands because of Deku. There will be no base if there is no Deku." He leaned back in his chair, and crossed his legs at the knees, "I will see to it."
The silence that rang in the room stung.
At that moment, the door slid open and Endeavor pushed the door in. Standing at the door, holding it open, Deku came in just a second later, and all those that respected him stood up immediately. The man who represented the new group stumbled to get up, but managed to do so. Behind him trailed Twice and Compress. Twice immediately moved to stand at the back of the room while Compress pulled the chair out at the head of the table. The young man waved him off as he grabbed the arms of the chair and jumped up. He was rolled in to the table, and once he was settled, he gave a wave for the rest of them to relax. Endeavor checked the hallway once before he closed the door and stood next to it. Compress backed away to the other corner closest to Deku.
Looking at them, no one would doubt that Deku was anything but their one and only leader.
"Sit down. We're getting started immediately."


### spn

"So you... what? Made a deal with everything that could kill you with a breath?" Hawks asked, beyond surprised.
Midoriya shifted from foot to foot, his eyes downcasted and Hawks didn't fall for it. He wasn't going to just...
"There was someone I wanted to protect," he said quietly. 
"And you had to partition and sell your soul to every single monster because of it?"
He gave this little nod.
"I was 8. I didn't have anything else to give."
"You were 8?" Hawks said, "What were you doing at age 8 that required you to sell your soul?!"
But Midoriya clearly had an answer for this, because he had a sheepish grin on his face.
"Hide and seek!"
And it did nothing to alleviate Hawks' concerns. 

-

"I need to go make money," Hawks said, rubbing the back of his neck. He shot Midoriya a stink-eye, but it softened when he saw how peacefully he was sleeping. With a quiet sigh, he pushed his hair back. "But I can't leave him alone."
Dabi, on the other side of Midoriya, batted Hawks' away before returning to his place curled up around Midoriya like a giant housecat. 
"Just use him to make money," he said.
Hawks' eyes immediately narrowed. "Then he'll bring people like you back."
Dabi flipped him off, before his hand curled back around Midoriya's middle. A deep rumble came from his chest as he pressed his nose against his hair.
"Yeah, whatever, just go," he said.
The disgust on the blond's face was apparent. 


### Limited Collection

"...So why did you-"
"You were willing to give up everything for him," Hawks said, motioning at Aizawa. "You took me out to dinner, went along with all of my whims, found all sorts of things, ran your funds dry," he laughed, "for some slave."
Midoriya's shoulders yanked backwards, his frustrations already on his face because Aizawa wans't just some slave-
"So I wanted to know too," he said, a grin on his face with the innocence of a child. "I wanted to know what it felt like to be cared for."
The fight deserted Midoriya in an instant. He stared back at the blond, opening and closing his mouth.
"Just kidding!" Hawks laughed back, "Did you really believe me?"
"What an asshole," Yamada muttered somewhere behind Midoriya.
"Just kill him and get it over with," Chisaki added. 
And Midoriya, reaching out to hold Hawks' hand, peered up at the man.
"You don't need to threaten someone else's life for that," he said. He laced their fingers together, watching the wonder in Hawks' eyes. "You are your own person, and no one else's replacement."
For a brief second, Hawks couldn't keep the smile on his face. Instead, he stared at Midoriya's spring green eyes and froze, like he was bewitched. His lips twitched, like he was suddenly aware that he wasn't smiling, but felt like he needed to.
"I..." 
He couldn't finish his sentence. He couldn't even start his sentence.
Midoriya squeezed his hand. 
A watery laugh escaped Hawks' lips.
"Okay," he said, "Okay."

-

"So we're out of money," Aizawa said.
In front of him, sitting on their knees, Midoriya sat between Yamada and Yagi. 
"And we have no supplies."
The three remained silent staring at the ground with ducked heads and hunched shoulders. 
"We have new faces," he glared at Hawks.
The blond grinned back with a lively wave from where he was sitting on a chair by the wall. Dabi, packing the last of their things, yawned like he wasn't apart of this.
"And this is our last night at the inn and we're going to get kicked out because we've overstayed our welcome."
"Well, Shota, I-"
Aizawa kicked Yamada's chin, and turned his dispassionate eyes to the other two.
"Camping isn't that bad," Yagi tried, getting a quick whack across the temple from Aizawa.
He turned to Midoriya.
"What's your excuse?"
The young man gave him a small smile, "I'm glad you're okay."
The annoyance and irritation melted off of Aizawa. With a small sigh, he brought his hand up and gave him a gentle chop on the head. 
"Favoritism," Yamada hissed out. 
The door behind them opened, and Chisaki stuck his head in. "Negotiations failed."
"Alright," Aziawa pinched his nose. "Been sleeping in a bed for days but I don't even remember it."
"If it makes you feel better, we didn't sleep in beds either," Dabi replied back, slinging one of the bags over his shoudler and tossing Yagi the other pack.
Aizawa sighed deeply, but grabbed Dabi by the bag. He shook him a little, and when Dabi turned around with a scowl, scowled first.
"Give it," he said, "Since I'm the only one who slept on the bed."
