Sawada Tsunayoshi had disappeared for fiv eyears when Midoriya Izuku came into their lives.

"You cry because you're sad," Midoriya said. "It's okay."
"He needs to stop crying and grow up. Tsuna's dead. Has been for a while now. Move on."
Lambo's lips twisted into a scowl, electricity starting to track when Midoriya stood in front of him.
"It's okay," he said, "to cry because you miss someone and to be sad."
Reborn's gaze was cold, "And what would a child know about that?"
"Shut up, Reborn!" Lambo snapped back, "Not everyone is a cold-blooded and unfeeling bastard like you! Tsuna-nii did everything for you! Broke your curse! Fought for you! You don't-"
Midoriya's small hand grabbed Lambo's hair and yanked hard.
"No!"
The other two stared, startled.
"Crying doesn't mean sad, and sad doesn't mean crying!"
"Huh?"
"Because some people forget," Midoriya said, the youngest among them in a hundred different ways, "it doesn't mean that they're not sad. It means they forgot how to cry."

"Just shut up and let me protect you, Tsuna!"
And as the words came out of his mouth, Reborn realized what he had said. The silence between them was suffocating. 
Midoriya stared for a long time, looking at his feet and then back up.
"...I never saved you."
And he turned around to leave.
He didn't want to Replace Sawada Tsunayoshi, Vongola's Tenth. He didn't. He wanted to save these people who couldn't cry even though they were sad.
