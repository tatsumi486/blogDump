### immortals

"No," Nighteye's tone was firm.
"Nighteye-san," Midoriya said, "It's okay, because I won't die. This much won't break me."
The hero's face scrunched up, like he smelled something sour, and he grabbed Midoriya by the shoulders.
"This isn't a competition. This isn't a-a thing that you should be happy about-"
Midoriya's hands came up and held Nighteye's hands. Normally, he would have slapped such condescending hands away from him, but this was different. This was somehow warmer. 
Midoriya had forgotten what it was like for an adult to care about him.
"I won't die. You don't need to see the future for that," he said. His hands gripped Nighteye's in what he hoped was a reassuring grip. "And you don't need to worry about that and retire easy. The world will be in good hands."
He grinned. Lying to someone who cared about him was surprisingly easy. 
No matter what Nighteye said, broken ribs or punctured organs or what, Midoriya was certain that he wasn't going to die. And it wasn't like the pain was particularly unbearable or anything.
And well, he was clearly made for this. 
So Nighteye didn't have to look at him like that. Like there was something precious being lost or something. It was just him.

-

When they got Midoriya back, he smiled like nothing was wrong.
"Nothing?" Tsukauchi asked, "I... I understand if there's something you don't want to share. I understand, and it's okay if you don't want to share it. But I find it hard to believe that nothing happened."
Midoriya lifted his arms up, where even the doctors scratched their heads because he was in peak-health even though they found him in the charred remains of that lab.
"Nothing happened," Midoriya said. "I'm right as rain."
And when Tsukauchi relayed that to Yagi, he was in for a shock as the blond covered his eyes and took a shuddering sigh.

-

"Shounen. I..."
"All Might-san," Midoriya said, cutting him off with a smile that didn't belong on a person who was held in captivity for a week, "I'm fine! Really!" he said. "You don't have to think that there was someone you couldn't protect, or that there was someone you came too late to save. Because I'm fine."
He grinned like he never knew hurt, and All Might had spent enough time with Midoriya to know by now that it was a smile he used after dying a few times. 

-

"It should have been me," Midoriya murmured, because he wouldn't die even when he was killed. He placed his head into his hands. 
You would think that, since he couldn't die, he wouldn't have so many regrets.
Life didn't always work out like that. 


### good thing

"He just needs to stop pretending that he's in pain," the doctor said, "There's nothing wrong with him. Is he an only child?"
Inko nodded, "Y-yes, he is."
"Then he just wants some attention. That's all. Nothing to worry about. He's not actually in pain either. He's just acting up."
"But his nosebleeds..."
"Probably self-inflicted," the doctor said. He gave Midoriya a stern look like Midoriya didn't wake up with blood soaking his pillow from his nose and ears. "You need to knock that out, young man. No one likes an attention-seeker."
Which, Midoriya thought, was bullshit given the fact that they lived in a hero society but he was six and this man clearly didn't care about him.
Which. Midoriya thought was fair.
Where did villains come from? The answers got clearer with every passing day.

-

But Midoriya would recognize those disappointed blue eyes anywhere. He nearly fell in his effort to make a sudden turn and ran into a bunch of people who scowled and sneered at him, but he saw something that none of them would understand. Right there, there was that person who stood next to him, who burned the world down and himself with it with a laugh that lived inside of Midoriya. He was one of the only people in the entire world that could have been his friend.
"Dabi?"
His hand caught on the sleeve of his uniform. He was small, smaller than anything Midoriya remembered, butt his eyes craved to burn.
And that's what they got along on.
"What the fuck are you?" he hissed back.
He couldn't believe it. There was a time in his life where Dabi spoke with so much raw emotion. It was almost cute. Was this Dabi when he was a kid and he hadn't honed this bitter rage against the world like a blade? Amazing.
"You're so cute," Midoriya blurted out, but it didn't come out as teasing as it should have. He felt his eyes water, because the last he saw of Dabi he was just ash but now he was here, just a head taller than him.
A bright red flush, something that he never saw on Dabi before, crawled on his face.
"Huh?!"
Behind them, suddenly, a loud clatter occured. The two's head snapped forward, where a huge plume of smoke came up from above. It looked like there was a huge crash of some sort down the street. Wait, this was a chance to get some of those good deeds.
He released Dabi, in a few years, he would become a fine villain.
"You're fine the way you are," he said, words that he always wanted to say, but it didn't look like their paths would ever intersect again. Which was fine. This time, they could be strangers. "So just keep going."
Blue eyes, darted from the crash to him and then back, and when Midoriya turned to run towards the crash, felt his arm yanked backwards. He could count on one hand the number of times that Dabi touched him, and all of them ended with third-degree burns. He hissed, and tensed hard. It was better to just wait it out-
"Did you know?" Little Dabi hissed out, "Who... who are you?"
Midoriya stared at him, because he wasn't burning. He blinked, and under summer blue eyes, felt oddly scrutinized. 
"No one," he said, pulling futily at his arm, "I'm not anyone to you. Let me..."
A loud explosion occured. One of the cars must have caught on fire. There was a surge of people running away from the source of the explosion, and caught between the rush of people, Dabi's grip loosened. 
And Midoriya ran to the center of danger. There had to be someone that he could help and get his good deed of the day.

-

"Aren't you... like 12?"
"I'm 25!" Midoriya spluttered back.
There was a long period of silence before Twice grabbed him into a headlock.
"Are you? If you're 25 than I'm All Might! Don't make fun of your elders! // I'm a young man!"
Well, looks like Twice was All Might.

-

"Izuku! Your friend came over!"
And Midoriya felt every fiber in his body freeze, because the only people in the world who would introduce themselves as his friends were people that wanted to kill them. He could only hope that they wouldn't actually kill him in the apartment where his mother raised him.
He walked in, cautious and skeptical, and almost groaned when he saw him.
"Yo, Izuku."
"Dabi."
The white-haired man stared at him and gave a laugh, sounding at once too young and innocent for all the things Midoriya remembered doing with him. "You know, funny story about that. Before I met you, I didn't even want to be a hero. Not like... Not like the way that people knew heroes, at least."
Midoriya blanched. That was not a phrase he ever wanted to hear from Dabi.
The young man reached into his pocket and pulled something out. For a moment, Midoriya honestly thought that Dabi had changed and he was going to knife him instead of burn him, but instead, he brought a plastic card out. An identification card.
He handed it over.
"This is..."
"I passed the Pro-Hero examination," Dabi said with a crooked grin on his face. It looked wrong without the scars, without being surroudned by burnt corpses. "I decided on my hero name."
Midoriya's hands trembled as he loked at the ID card. his name was Todoroki Touya? His eyes trailed on the piece of plastic.
His hero name...
"Dabi. Named after that stupid kid that kept following me around. Fitting, isn't it?"
The hero named Dabi had perfect white teeth, they glimmer and they shined with the fraction of the light that played in his eyes.
"When you get yours," his long fingers, calloused from practice but not ruined from fire, took the card out of Midoriya's fingers, "Let's open an agency together and take Number One."
["Let's burn the world down together."]
And for the first time since Midoriya became a villain, he felt like he lost.
"I... what?"
"You," Touya said, speaking slowly and pointing to the young man, and then he motioned to himself, "and me." Using his pointer fingers, he made a small rectangle in the space in front of him, "Hero agency."
Oh. Midoriya blinked. Oh no.
"I don't get it," he said, shaking his head.
Touya's hands dropped to his sides. He took a deep long sigh, but he looked at Midoriya so fondly that Midoriya felt like he had to look away. That, since he once worked with Dabi and respected him and got along with him, he should look away when the man looked so damn vulnerable. 
And that's why he didn't see it when Touya reached for him. Ruffling his hair before roughly pulling him into a hug, thick arms wrapped around his shoulders as he shook him.
"You're an idiot," he said, "but you're my idiot."
He pulled back.
"I gotta report for duty, so we have to celebrate later," he said. The place where his warmth had invaded into Midoriya's body tingled, and made him feel cold.
Touya ruffled his hair one more time.
"Don't get any stupider. I'll see you around." And he stopped at the kitchen for a quick, "Sorry, Inko-kaa-san. I gotta run and save the world. I'll be back for dinner another day," like he was a guest here.
He left like that. No fire. No death. No despair. Nothing.

-

In that instant, Midoriya understood something.
This [system] could not let him die.
His lips curled. Was this what it was like to be a hero? To have the whole world and everything in life to work perfectly out for him? Because this was perfect.
If Midoriya no longer had to worry about himself, then that made it easier for him to fight. 
After all, the last time he died, he had to become a hero. If he died this time- what did they want from him.
"Haha..." the laugh came bubbling out as his hand came to his side. This was some fucking bullshit. He had to do good things. Was this an experiement? Did they think that, if he did enough 'good things', he would suddenly become a good person? What a joke.
There was a knife in between his ribcage, blood caking the inside of his mouth, and four of his fingers completely broken, but he was just getting started.
"I'm here," he said, eyeing the man he cornered in the alleyway, "to help you."

-

The worst of villains weren't that bad after all. Midoriya had an entire lifetime of making them dance to his tune. Now that he was a hero, the only thing that changed was that he was playing in a major scale instead of a minor one, or so he'd like to think. The tempo had changed, the maestro hadn't.
He took a deep breah, looking down on society for a different reason than he used to, and jumped off the building. His overture would be a purse-snatcher.

### [jigsaw machine]
>> Hawks & Mido are soulmates
>> govt takes Hawks. Tracks down Midoriya. 
>> ma and pa Mido get into unfortunate accident, and leaves Midoriya in their capable hands 
>> this is wrong and there is something wrong, but in order to preserve order & protect the 75% of average citizens, the ends will get clipped, on all sides
>> cue all might giving midoriya OFA & now yagi v commission (?)
>> midoriya doesn't attend UA.

"When I was a kid," Midoriya said, "all I wanted to do was become a hero. I wanted to help people. I wanted to see a world where everyone can smile together." His eyes fell to the ground, a small smile on his face, "I think that, hearing someone tell me it's impossible and I should wake up and face reality isn't a solution. It's someone who's waiting to be saved."
Yagi stared at him, the gentle smile on his face, and wondered if this was what it felt like to be saved.
"Even if it's not today, or tomorrow, or even in my lifetime." He gave a grin to ALl Might, "I don't want the light your light to fade."
Yagi's heart squeezed painfully in his chest. He had forgotten how crippling relief could feel. 
"I'll save everyone I meet. One person at a time. As many times as needed."
He grinned.
"Let AFO take me."

-

Supposedly, they were supposed to take advantage of a [soulmate] bond. It was perfect because Midoriya had no one, nothing, except for Hawks. And Hawks was the same. From there, they just needed to be raised with the understanding that being a Hero wasn't easy and not everyone can be saved. 
Hawks would become the most Reliable Hero, and quirkless Midoriya would be his best support. Everything, from helping him heal faster to support equipment, Midoriya would be able to do anything and everything in order to make Hawks a better hero. In theory.
In theory.
Often, putting theories in practice ruined them. 
Mesa covered his face.
"I don't understand," he said, rubbing his face. There was not enough hours in the day to sleep, but it felt like his work these days had quadrupled. "You said you went out to play. There were three guards on you."
Sitting with a shock blanket around his shoulders, snot dribbling down his face and face blotchy with how much he's been crying, was Midoriya Izuku. Fluttering nervously around him, Hawks (who flew away from the middle of training which alerted them that something was seriously wrong) held a pair of hot chocolates in his trembling hands.
"How did you end up in the center of another serial murder case?" Mesa bemoaned. The paperwork. The paperwork...!

-

"You knew?!" Hawks snapped back, and even Endeavor looked shocked at the volume that escaped his normally amiable coworker. The winged hero didn't seem to notice as he took a step closer to Midoriya, his wings closed in and ruffled. "You knew that this... that the worst villain in Japan history was out and about and coming after you? And you just... you didn't even tell me."
"I thought it would be better like this."
"Better?!" Hawks' voice was ringing off the walls, or maybe it just felt like that because it was so strange to see him yell like this. "Where, Izuku? Where in this... this shitfight did you see a silver lining? I must be blind because I can't seem to see it anywhere!"
"I have you," Midoriya said. "That's the only silver lining I need."
The weight of someone's [trust] was a heavy thing, to the point where it might crush Hawks. 

-

"This can't be a good thing," Enji said quietly, feeling that someone needed to say it. 
Midoriya shrugged back, "Taking a bad situation and making it not as bad is what makes a hero so cool."
Blue eyes watched the way Midoriya's hands trembled.
"Endeavor-san, could I make a request?"
Enji remained silent, and Midoriya took it as an invitation to speak.
He gave a trembling grin, telling wonders of how much courage it took to say anything at all.
"The only people I'll leave behind is Hawks and All Might-san. Hawks always kicks his sheets off but he's sensitive to the cold. And All Might always forgets to eat medicine with his meals," he said, giving him a deep bow, "Please look after them."
"Denied."
Midoriya's head snapped up, a brief flicker of hurt crossing his features. It gave Enji some relief, that this kid could still be hurt and wasn't so far gone that he had lost that too.
"Don't push your work to someone else and do it yourself. Prioritize your return."
Green eyes welled with tears. Enji turned his gaze out the window and towards the horizon. Augh, he was so bad at this. Why did they leave him with a child? He doesn't even get along with his children.
"My favorite kind of hero," he said, because he's been thinking a lot about these kinds of things now, "are the heroes that return alive and well."
At the same time, he couldn't help but wonder. Midoriya, who only felt pain when other people got hurt, what kind of hero would he become?
He couldn't wait to see.
All Might gave him the nastiest look when he saw the dried tear-stains on Midoriya's face. And Endeavor didn't bother suppressing his snort.

[Kids wanna grow up because they think that adults don't have any weaknesses but being an adult means accepting your weakness.]

### sat
Obviously, he dreamed about moments like this. 
Midoriya, underneath him, the warmth of his body against his. Things of that nature.
Usually, in his dreams, they aren't in an abandoned building like this, getting hunted down by a monster with intentions similar to Dabi but a little uglier. 
Yeah, his dreams usually featured more pleasure than pain. And Midoriya was awake, concious, and a willing (and normally enthused) participant. 
"Midoriya-" Dabi's voice was barely a rasp, "-fuck." 
His arms were shaking from the effort of keeping himself from collasping on top of Midoriya. Whatever it was that fell on him (plaster or part of wall, maybe some pipes, a bookshelf?), was heavy. 
And Midoriya, unconcious and blissfully ignorant, was beautiful. 
More than not crushing Midoriya, Dabi just wanted to stare just a little bit longer.
And even if it was just for the few seconds until his arms gave out, he wanted to protect Midoriya's peaceful expression.

-

Midoriya's eyes fluttered open before the pain settled in. He gave a hiss. Nothing was more annoying than waking up with a splitting headache. And then the pain in his back and legs came.
"Hey there, sleeping beauty."
He froze before his eyes flew up and open. Half a foot from his face was Dabi, exhaustion stretching his face as he gave a crooked grin at the omega in his arms.
"I'm about to collaspe," he rasped out, "Can you get us out?"
It was an easy fix with OFA.
Midoriya gave him a piercing look as Dabi plopped down onto his butt. His arms, beyond exhausted, laid limp and trembling in his lap. He hunched over, taking deep breaths. He stood up and looked around.
"Take a minute," Midoriya said. He didn't know how long he had been out, but since no one found them, enemies or allies, he supposd that they could take the next couple minutes to breath. His ribs ached with every breath, using his quirk so suddenly like that was not agreeing with him. At the very least, they had a few moments to breath and recenter themselves.
And Dabi must have been even more tired than he let on, for there were no witty remarks or sacrastic replies. 
Midoriya wondered what Dabi was working so hard for. If he thought that it was worthwhile.

-

"...Your quirk," Chisaki said quietly, "is killing you." 
"A lot of things are killing me. Others are just waiting for an opportunity to."
"You're not wrong, " he said, "but at least I can do something about those. This?" he made a motion to Midoriya, the mess he came back as this time, "this is all you. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you're trying to die."
"You know better?"
"If you wanted to die, you'd be dead," Chiaki said, turning back to shift through their medicinal cabinent, "and I would be half a step behind you." 
Being told that someone would rather die than be alone always made Midoriya's stomach twist.
"Good think you konw better then," he said.
"Truly? Do you?" Chisaki asked, his tone flat. "I can't tell."
Midoriya placed his hand across his ribcage. Even without Chisaki saying anything, Midoriya knew. there was something still missing. Something wasn't fitting well. He loked at his hands.
OFA....If it really was that the collection of someone's wish for a better world, the passing of a quirk with all their hopes and dreams, then were they unsatisfied with him. He wouldn't blame them. Either from all the blood he's spilled or his undesirable status as an omega, neither were probably acceptable.
His hands closed into fists. It was okay. He was fine with that. Being unaccepted, being unacceptable, it was all things that he was used to.
Chisaki turned back around, handing him his modified gun.
"Don't forget to come back."
But this?

-

"Thank you," Overhaul said as soon as he saw the hero.
Hawks, his front soaked in Midoriya's blood, was leaning against the hallway.
"Then, is he..."
Chisaki nodded, "He'll live. I'll see to that."
The blond closed his eyes, head tilted back and took a deep breath though his nose.
"Okay. So, what are you thanking me for?"
"Bringing him back."
The blond gave a little chuckle, and pushed off the wall to stand in front of Overhaul. He gave a full bow.
"Me too then, thank you for keeping him alive."
Overhual snorted, and Hawks gave a small chuckle.

-

"When I was a kid, I used to dream about this," Kirishima said quietly, "Doing stakeouts with other heroes, talking and making my ideal support equipment, training to become stronger, coming home to what I protected. Things like that."
Aizawa's hand came up to the commlink, ready to inform the young man that he was speaking into the main channel.
"Even if it isn't the way I imagined it," Kirishima said quietly, "I'm glad that I can still do it. Not like a Pro-Hero like Red-Riot, but I can still be like Red Riot. I still have someone to protect, something to fight for."
He took a deep breath in, a part of him wishing to let Kirishima have this moment for himself. He knew that it was better for him to say it than for someone like Shigaraki or godforbid Stain, come on the commlink instead.
"But what about you, Izuku? What are you fighting for?"
His hands stilled. He wanted an answer. Morbid curisoity, even if he was listening in on a conversation that he had no part listening into.
"...If you know or don't, does it matter?"
"I guess not."
"Then-"
"But I wanna know more about you."
Aizawa shouldn't do this. Aizawa couldn't do this. His hand went to the commlink.
"You guys are on the main channel."
"Aw! Come on, Shota!" Yamada whined.
"Just got to the good part," Mina whined next. "I wanted to know! It was such a good atmosphere!"
They spent way too much time together.
"All of you," Aizawa spoke clearly, "Back to work."

-

In any relationship, communication was key. 
So Midoriya, who never spoke and never spoke honestly, didn't understand at what point they made a relationship.
"Izuku, are you okay?"
Midoriya stared, a bit of a daze as Toyomitsu leaned down in front of him. A massive hand came up to his face, and Midoriya leaned into it.
When did he start to look for the touch of another person?
He wasn't fine. He wasn't. He wanted someone to look at him and hold him and tell him that it was okay that he wasn't fine without it because it was human, not that it was normal because he was an umated omega. He just. The exhaustion pushed at his shoulders, a force that could replace gravity for all that it pinned him to this earth. A shaky breath escaped his mouth as he closed his eyes.
Toyomitsu, gentle Toyomitsu, was beautiful as he was kind. It was painful.
Midoriya batted the hand away, and pushed onto his feet. A large hand came to catch his shoulder, helping steady him and Midoriya shrugged it away. He stepped out, looking around and seeing the monster that he managed to kill on his fall down. He looked up. They fell quite a while. He vaguely remembered, through his throbbing headache, that there were at least two more monsters that he didn't get to. 
"Endeavor-san reported that he burned two," the blond reported, and Midoriya jolted. "Everyone already reported in over the comms. Our only injury was a bad sprained ankle from Shigaraki. Nothing's moved for the last twenty minutes."
He didn't ask, and he really wanted to know, but he didn't ask. Why did he have to say everything that Midoriya wanted to know? He looked at the ground.
This relationship, where he didn't talk and they never listened, should have fallen apart.
Instead, Midoriya was starting to forget what it was like to be alone.
"I'm glad that you're alive," Toyomitsu said, "But your head is bleeding. Before we move on, do you mind letting me look at that?"
Midoriya's hand came up to his head. Indeed, the blood was dribbling down from his hairline. He thought it was just more sweat. He wiped at it, smearing the blood and touched again. It wans't bleeding, at the very least. 
He just. He looked at Toyomitsu, the regret instead of his jovial smile, and turned away.
He didn't want this. He didn't want to treasure them. He liked being strangers. Everything was easier when they were strangers. 
"I don't want to like you," he blurted out, covering his eyes, "so stop."
Toyomitsu stared at him for a moment longer, a big wide grin came onto his face, one that made Midoriya's heart clench because he looked so bright like that, like he just walked off a poster promoting general safety.
"Izuku, I don't know why you don't want to like anyone. I don't know if you're scared to, if someone's hurt you, or if you're afraid to be alone again," he said, "but life's too long to spend by yourself and life's too short to pretend you're not lonely."
He grinned.
"I'm not saying you have to change who you are right now. Not saying that we should be buddy-buddy and wearing matching sweaters starting tomorrow. I'm just saying that it's okay to be happy and to do things that make you happy."
That was the problem with alphas, Midoriya was reminded.
For omegas, happiness was weakness. Happiness was when their guard was down and when tragedy struck because that was when omegas trust the most. And therefore, that was when omegas were most likely to get struck down.
The rminder was humbling. He could feel himself coming out of that warm daze. Because more than comfort, and more than happiness, and more than anything else in the whole wide world, Midoriya wanted one thing.
Freedom.

-

"Why... did you save me?" 
Midoriya staared at him for a long moment, blinking twice and then said, "Oh."
It was a quiet sound, but it was so simple.
"...It... It didn't even occur to you? That you didn't have to save me? That you could have just left me be?" 
Midoriya covered his face. What an oversight.
Behind him, Nighteye gave this helpless laugh, like he couldn't believe it. The way that people had to be convinced or had to justify saving someone, Midoriya had to do the same to not save them. 

-

"Asking for help won't kill you."
Midoriya closed his eyes and took a deep, slow breath through his nose.
"...And I guess you already got this lecture from someone?" Hawks replied.
He lifted his hand up and extended his index finger, "Gran Torino," he extended his middle finger next, "Endeavor," then his ring finger, "Nighteye," and his pinky, "Shigaraki."
"Shigaraki?"
Midoriya side-eyed him before he turned his hand over so that he was palm up. He put down his thumb, "Todoroki," and then his index finger, "Todoroki," and then his middle finger, "Iida," and then his ring finger, "All Might-"
"-Okay, okay," Hawks said, lifting his hands up, "I get it." He took a deep breath, but couldn't think to be too upset when he saw the ghost of a smile on Midoriya's face. Tiliting his head to the side, he asked quietly, "Is it that bad? Calling for help?"
"I don't want to."

### apoc

The problem with combat training was that it was just training

So seeing Shigaraki's body stumble backwards, seeing him fall through where glass should have been if Deku didn't break all of it earlier, it made something inside of Deku scream out. 
["Don't let him fall"]
A voice that didn't belong to anyone he knew repeated in his head. 
He must have been knocked out, because Shigaraki's eyes weren't even awake. However, Deku's arms wrapped around his middle, and he could feel his heartbeat against his ear. For the second, they would be okay.
The hulking mass of a monster that knocked Shigaraki out of the 15th floor came crawling out. Given the size of it, it was squeezing itself to get out through the broken windows. 
Wind rushing at his back, Deku gritted his teeth. If they were at least closer to the fire exit, he could have grabbed something to break their fall. It would be better to break their bones than lose their lives. 
["I won't let you fall."]
Weightless. 
Deku blinked, because the world wasn't falling anymore. It wasn't blurring past him, counting down the seconds before he and Shigaraki became a splattered mess on the ground. Briefly, he thought that he had already died, when he saw her.
With a smile gentle like morning light, there was a beautiful woman with black hair and a long cape. Her hands grabbed Deku's arms, and briefly, Deku wondered if he had met an angel.
Her smile turned warmer.
["Not quite."] She spoke without moving her lips. ["I'm the 8th Holder."] Deku felt breathless. ["I won't let you fall."]

-

"I'm not a hero," he tried.
"What else do I call someone who puts in every effort to save every person they come across?"
"If I killed more people than I saved, am I really a hero?"
The man laughed back, an enriching sound like it came from the depths of the world. 
"Deku, what defines a hero isn't you. It's the people around you."
Green eyes stared, and the former owner of OFA grabbed his shoulders.
"Take it from me. I would know. You are a hero."
 
Deku woke up, tears streaming from his eyes and feeling as though he could breath for the first time in a long, long time.

-

"Toshinori," Deku called out, "The... The previous holder, your teacher, she... did she have black hair?"
Yagi blinked, "Shimura-sensei? Yes, she did."
"And her... her hair," Deku tried to lift his arms, winced, and just made a motion at his head instead, "half of it was up in a bun?"
Blue eyes, as though remembering something far away, nodded. "Yes, that's her."
And Deku's eyes welled with tears, dropping from his eyes and onto the sheets on his lap. Yagi jolted, more than surprised as Deku's hand dropped to the sheets and this helpless laugh tumbled clumsily from his lips.
"She's beautiful."
Yagi's heart warmed. It had been a long time since he could remember her without aching, but Deku worried him.
"Yes," he said, "she was."
Eventually, with broken sentences and the occational tear, Deku informed him of a beautiful woman, slightly translucent and framed by the sunlight behind her, and that she promised not to let them fall. 
"...Deku-shounen," Yagi said while handing a glass of water towards his student, "I think that they are giving you their quirk, giving you their hopes, because they know that you are a hero. It took some time, but I
