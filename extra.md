### inko the isekai-er

Inko shot up in bed, her eyes wide. She remembered now! This was a game! That ridiculous game that took her over 160 hours and seven box of tissues to complete! My Hero Academia that everyone (including her) was waiting for the sequal.
And her head snapped to the side where the picture of the body she owned and her child was framed on the side.
She was the mother of the main character!
...Shit.

-

- so 20-yo!regular lady becomes inko
- encourages izuku to adopt as many of the future villains as possible like "
- takes a long time before she realizes that these are realass people and she totally and completely changed their lives
- izuku is hella $$-motivated. doesn't really wanna be a hero, because making money off of other people's suffering sounds wrong, but everyone tells him that he's the best hero since he can't turn down a person in need
- shigaraki -> gran torino/all might's hero, wanna be izuku's sidekick
- dabi -> ends up working as endeavor's secretary, learning the ins/outs to jump over to izuku's hero agency when it opens
- nine (and slice) + chimera -> former mercs running a small diner w/ infomat dealings on the side and sliding inko (and therefore izuku) 
-  so everything is ready for izuku to have a much easier time than she did clearing those stupid boss mechanics 
- but now izuku doesn't want to be a hero. just wanna make stupid $$ (in tech? support gear?) and she's like ????

"...Don't you want to be a hero? Go to UA?"
And he stared at her for a moment and then looked down at the ground. 
"...Okay," he said quietly, "I'll do that, mom."
She crouched down in front of him. Did he have a stomachache? Maybe he was just hungry.
"Should we go out to eat tonight? Your favorite, Katsudon!"
And Little Izuku opened his mouth, as though to say something and then closed it. She wondered when he would break out of his shy-character. It wasn't like anyone was bullying him, so shouldn't he be more confident? Brighter?
Well, nothing good food and rest would help. She supposed that a growing boy would be tired. It wasn't easy to be a hero-in-training.

"...My mom and I used to make donkatsu together," Izuku said quietly. "We would take turn hitting the meat with a hammer, and weI would cover it in the flour and put it in the egg, and then she'd press the breadcrumbs on it, and she'd fry it. She'd always be like "is this brown enough, Hero-san?" and I would be like, "i think that's brown enough, sidekick!" and it would take the whole day and our eyes would burn after wards. The house would smell like fried food for  three days afterwards but I..."
Izuku closed his eyes, as though he could just see it, a kitchen with his All Might drawings, the smell of oil heating, feel the flour on his face, the 
"...I think, more than the taste, that part meant more to me."

"It's worth it," Ban Yeoryung cried. She wiped at her eyes and rubbed them hard, even red-rimmed, they were breathtaking. Fat tears ran down her face and the words came out strangled, and still, she was beautiful. "It doesn't hurt. I can do it."
"...Yeoryung?" Dan-i whispered back. As the main lead, she supposed it wouldn't be this easy.
"I'll protect it. The world where-where we eat ice cream together. The world where we s-sleep next to each other. I'll do it," she said. "I'll protect the world that I share with my Dan-i."
Dan-i, on occasion, wondered what had happened in their past, that this beautiful woman was so loyal to her. The original Ham Dan-i must have been someone equally beautiful to have earned that loyalty. 
"Yeo-ryung," she said, collecting her hands, and smiled. "Having you here is enough for me." She leaned in, pushing her long hair behind her ear, and grinned. "Every day I get to spend with you is my most precious treasure."
