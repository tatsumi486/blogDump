"Izuku! There you are! What are you thinking, keeping me waiting? Such a silly omega, that's why everyone calls you a 'Deku'!" 
Dabi frowned, and stepped forward. The fire already collected at his fingers, and he narrowed his eyes. This guy is dead. Just. Dead. They don't need people who were going to put down their leader. 
But before Dabi's fire got to him, Izuku spoke up with a simple question.
"Do you know who Midoriya Inko is?"
"Do I-" the man spluttered, afronted that such a thing was asked, "Of course I know who my wife is! That's your mother, you know! Why are you calling her by her name! You still haven't learned your manners? That's why you're still unbonded. All these alphas and they would rather be alone than be with you-"
Izuku handed him a ID card, and suddenly, Dabi understood.
"My condolensces."
The man took the card in his shaky hands, and Izuku turned around.
"W-What-what the hell is this?!" he screamed out, "Get back here and explain this, Izuku! I said, get back here!"
But not even an alpha's [command] could make Izuku do anything. He didn't even pause, and moved as though nothing had been said at all.
If it were true, Dabi wondered how Izuku had saddled with the weight of his mother's blood on his hands this whole time. He thought about Izuku, who snuck extra snacks for the children on base (did he really think that Dabi wouldn't notice?), kept tabs on popular recreational activities for people to do, never hesitated to spend more time looking for lost-causes, who walked forward with a blank expression. 
"Damn, the bastard is still screaming."
"He's mourning," Izuku replied, "It's to be expected."
What about you? Dabi asked. Even if that man and that ID-card wasn't his dad and mom, Izuku must have lost the same amount every other civilian lost from the start of this to now, right? They've lost a few since they started living here too. Did he mourn? 
Or was he more like Dabi? Did Izuku only gain things since he made a base here?
The questions lodged in his throat. Even if he did get an answer, he knew that their relationship wouldn't change. 
But the thought that Izuku would share anything about himself, had his heart teetering dangerously and that blasted feeling -hope- came creeping up. Pathetic didn't even begin to describe how he felt.

-

"Normally, you ask the omega's father or mother, whichever is the alpha, and ask them for their omega's hand in marriage," Aizawa explained, "so, in those terms, it's important to know if he's actually your dad or not."
"Shame omegas don't have opinions or feelings of their own," Izuku added, "It'd make life a lot simpler."
As though waiting for this, Shigaraki sat up.
"I didn't care," he said, almost bragging. 
Izuku and Aizawa ignored him.
"What do you think?"
"It'd be nice if my mate's parents liked me," he said, "It's not nessesary, and it's not like, just because they don't like me, I'm going to give up on my mate. It's just a formality, really."
The omega looked at the ground, but didn't say anything more.
"If my mate trusts me and loves me, that's all I need," Aizawa concluded. "What about you?"
There was a moment of silence before he spoke up. "I never really thought about it," he said. "It's not like I had anything to do with the decision, no atter what I said." He tilted his head to the side and gave a small smile, like there was something parituclarly amusing about this entire thing. He admitted, "I guess it's because omegas don't have opinions or feelings of their own."
He chuckled at his own joke, but Aizawa failed to find the humor of it.
"I don't get why it's funny," Shigaraki blurted out. "And I don't really get anything about this," he waved his hand out, "I have your back, you have mine. What more do you need?"
The look the former hero gave him was withering.
"You're right," Izuku murmured, his gaze turning far-away. "What more do I need?"

-

"Hawks! What did you see there?"
Hawks lifted his hands up as he was immediately bombarded as he touched ground.
Before he could say anything, Kan pushed forward.
"I understand how you feel, but please give him some space to breath," he said, hands up in a placating gesture.

### backline tanker
>> s-gate: cyclops 
[high p def, high vitality, and since they're S, high attk :<]
[dungeon boss: 4-armed cyclops]

And then, streaming live and and being watched all around the world, the impossible happened.
Endeavor, who had been torn in two and impaled through the head, had been revived. Ten minutes after his death, when his body had ran cold and the Commission had confirmed the disappearance of his heartbeat and his magic had run cold, he stood up. Looking to be whole and hearty, the man looked just as shocked as the rest of the world watching. 
Standing next to him was the small and unimpressive Midoriya Izuku. The Supporter that everyone claimed was not good enough and had lied to get his S-Ranked reading. That there was no way that Midoriya, who was small of his age 
Japan's one and only S-Rank Supporter had proved, in that single moment, that he stood heads and shoulders above any other Supporter in hunter-history. 
There had never been a hunter who had been revived.
When people die. They're dead. Even for hunters, that hadn't changed.
The sheer magnitude of power that came from him as a result, however, had the Dungeon Boss turning towards him. Viewers everywhere, who had seen the mess that this Cyclops left the Nation's top hunters in, watched with baded breath it came storming for the small supporter.
"Where the hell do you think you're going?!" Best Jeanist yelled out, his quirk worked in conjunstion to his magic, but the monsters ripped through it without any problems. Like a demon possessed, it paved a path straight for their young supporter.
"Get out of there!" Shigaraki yelled out. On the last fumes of his magic, he tried desperately to call forth his magic, just anything, to buy the supporter some more time. 
That surge of magic was no joke. Shigaraki could hardly believe that they could both be called S-Rankers when their magic-capabilities were legions apart.
And on National Television, Midoriya took a step to the side, his hand came to his mouth and blood sprayed from between his fingers. His eyes closed tightly, but he wiped his mouth and closed his hand into a fist. Eyes open and hardened with determination, he brought his fist out forward. Using the blood soaking his hand, the magic around him pulsed. 
He heard of it, of course, everyone had. Magic came from anything alive, much like oxygen did. While it was unclear how it was made or where it came from, it moved freely like air. People breathed it in, and some people could just hold more than others.
And for people who had a strong affinity with their magic, it was obvious even in their blood. Their blood was magic concentrated. Stronger than normal spells, their blood contained more magic, similar to how some people used mana rocks or enchanted equipment. 
Needless to say, every drop of Midoriya's blood contained more magic than he could normally call. Using his blood as a medium called forward more magic.
With that magic, Midoriya concentrated and laid all his magic into the area in front of him. As the boss of the dungeon came screaming at him, he raised the barrier. 
The S-Rank Dungeon Boss stilled like it had been turned into stone. Seven feat in front of Midoriya, the Supporter stood unflinching. The monster, in jerky movements, inched a few centimeters at a time. 
"Move."
And the recently revived Endeavor stepped in front of Midoriya, his magic rippling through the air and crackling around him. From above, All Might came down with his sword. The combination attack of the Strongest Attackers in Japan at point-blank had finally done it.
The cyclops was charred and sliced through. The magic gem laid out next to him. As though reacting to the death of the dungeon boss, the S-Class Gate began to close. The remaining monsters scrambled to the gate, but the rest of their attack group hunted them down swiftly.
"The gate has been closed!" All Might yelled out, his voice reverberating throughout the battlefield. "We are the victors!"
And then Midoriya fell to his knees. He coughed loudly, and chunks of his blood sprayed on the ground. 
"Midoriya!" Endeavor whipped around, when he was suddenly surrounded by a green glow. "Stop casting! It's over! Drop the barriers!"
Midoriya shook his head. Slowly, the remains of their injuries, and even their fatigue started to fade.
"Midoriya!"
The young man's furrowed brow started to smooth. Bringing his hand away from his mouth, he wiped at his mouth. Slowly getting up, he swayed on his feet but managed to stay upright. 
"I'll lower the barrier once the magic levels stabilize," Midoriya promised, "but I'm not going to release all this magic out as it."
And as promised, Midoriya did not release that barrier for the two weeks it took for the magic levels to stabilize. For a while, Japan's Okinawa had a boom in tourists, hunters who wanted to come and experience the barrier of an S-Ranker for themselves. 
Japan's S-Rank Gate ended with zero injured, zero casualties, and zero deaths. A first in history. 
And until the next S-Gate Midoriya Izuku went into, the only one.

"There's a lot of people that say that you faked [revival magic]," the interviewer said, "What do you have to say to that?"
"I..." Midoriya hesitated, eyebrows furrowing as he tilted his head, like he couldn't understand the question. "I think it's best that people think that."
"Really?"
Midoriya gave the interviewer this look, like he couldn't believe how stupid this woman was. "I don't think there's any hunter in the world that would be happy that their party members die."
The interviewer seemed to lose her words.
"...But, is the [revival magic] real?" she pushed on. 
Midoriya stared at her, the camera, and then back to her. At his baffled silence, another person entered the scene.
"Does Endeavor look dead to you?" Shigaraki asked, dropping into the interview without any prior engagement. He took a seat right next to Midoriya, bringing an armaround his shoulders and bringing him closer. Despite how much Midoriya didn't like him, he liked Shigaraki a lot more than the strange interviewer and her strange questions. He leaned into the touch of the strong attacker, and Shigaraki's grin widened. "Hate to interupt, but we need him to keep us alive." He turned to Midoriya, "C'mon, we got reservations at the Taco place I was telling you about."
Midoriya sat up a little more, the earlier frown replaced by the stars in his eyes, and Shigaraki stared at him for a moment longer before reaching a hand out to ruffle his hair. Instead of slapping him away, however, Midoriya giggled.
"W-When can we go?" he asked.
"Right now," Shigaraki replied, getting up. 
Green eyes flitted to the interviewer and then back.
"What are they going to do?" he asked, "Stop us?"
Midoriya blinked at him, like he had never considered that. He stood up. 
"Excuse us," he said to the interviewers, and rushed to stand next to Shigaraki, "Are we taking a car? I've never ridden in a car before."
"You've never riden a car before?" Shigaraki replied back, staring at him in shock.
"I've ridden a golem before. It almost gave Dabi a heart-attack."

"He's so cool!" Natsuo whined, head in his hands. "Oh my god, he's so cool in 1080 HD!"
Touya pointed at the TV, and the enlarged clip of Midoriya setting up a barrier around Okinawa. "This one," he told the salesclerk, "And you guys deliver?"
The salesclerk flustered and nodded, "Yes! I will deliver anything to you! Free of charge!"
"Oh? That's nice."
"Yes! Let me get that paperwork for you! Not a problem at all! Please, come right this way!"
"Nat-kun," Touya called to his brother, "Are you coming or are you just going to fangirl."
"Oh like you were any better," Natsuo hissed back, but came to his brother's side. "You think only one TV's going to be enough for the office?"
"We can always buy more later," Touya said, "but apparently, Midoriya's never had his own TV. Can't wait to see the look on his face."
Natuso snickered behind his hands, and for just a second, it was like they were mischevious kids again, planning on dropping a pie on Fuyumi's head when she came back from club activities.

"Dabi told me that I should do what makes me happy," Midoriya said, his voice as soft as his touch. "

"But hunters, you know?" Midoriya said, reaching out to grab a few of his fingers. "Once we lay our eyes on prey, we won't let it go."
Hawks' eyes darkened, and his hand turned to hold Midoriya's properly.
"And the hunter becomes the hunted..." he muttered. He tilted his head and gave a small grin, "Alright," he said. "I don't mind getting hunted by you." He took a step closer to him, and leaned his head so that their foreheads leaned against each other.
"But I don't know how to make you happy," Midoriya said, closing his eyes.
"You already did," he murmured back, he released his hand to wrap his arms around his body and pulled him close. It felt decieving, that someone could feel so warm even though they were in a t-shirt in the blistering cold.

-

"So I'll be one of you starting today."
Natsuo had this look on his face, like someone had smeared dog shit all over his car, and he grumbled something or another back. 
"Hm?" Hawks tilted his head to the side, "did you say something?"
Natsuo scowled back as he turned away. "No, nothing."
The blond beamed back, and Natsuo chewed on the inside of his cheek. 
"Are you guys..." he hesitated, "really dating?"
"I thought it was nothing?" Hawks replied back, but it was clear from the look on Natsuo's face that he wasn't going to have it. The tilted his head, and gave an easy, "Yeah, we are. What about it?"
And Natsuo made this face. It was so strange to see someone look so vulnerable, and Hawks almost felt like he kicked a small puppy. But Natsuo clenched his jaw tightly and furrowed his brows. 
And suddenly, he whipped around. Of course, pretty much everyone was moving in slow-motion in Hawks' eyes, and he whispered out.
"Please take good care of him."
Hawks' eyebrows hiked up his forehead. He knew, or at least, had an idea on what Midoriya must have meant to Natsuo. He didn't blame him, it wasn't like he was any different. 
But they were different breeds altogether. He wouldn't have given up. He wanted to be happy, even if it meant that the entire world would suffer for it. 
Well, he supposed that, if he never met Midoriya, if he never learned that he could be [happy], he wouldn't have ever turned out like this either. Staring at at Natsuo, he wouldn't believe that the tanker that Midoriya trusted the most was a guy who knew how to [give up] after seeing the smile on Midoriya's face.
"I will," he promised, more to himself than anyone else, because he wouldn't give up even if the skies came down.
"A-And you guys ate it?" Midoriya's voice carried down the hallway as he came into the office with Dabi. 
"Yep. Nat-kun earned his 'fatass' nickname."
Natsuo gave this long sigh, but his eyes lingered on Midoriya's form and Hawks wondered who he was lying to.
"Midoriya!" he called out, waving his arm.
Let them all see the stars he could put in Midoriya's eyes. Let them all see and get lost in the wonder of a galaxy dyed in green. Let them all see the way Midoriya came bouncing up to him, and let them sit and brood in their jealousy when Hawks' arms wrap around him and hold him tight. Let them, because it's all they would ever get from Midoriya. 
"Hawks!" Midoriya's arms came right under his, wrapping around his torso as he buried his face against his chest. He squeezed just a little, and if he hadn't, maybe Hawks would have completely fallen apart.
"Ready for today?" he asked, basking in the warmth of Midoriya's embrace and the heat of Dabi's glare.
Midoriya nodded his head against his chest and slowly took a step back. A pretty blush painted across his cheeks. 
"Sorry," he said, "I-I got excited."
"Me too," Hawks said, bright and beaming, "I missed you."
For just a brief second, a flicker of confusion crossed Midoriya's features, but before the blond could address it, Dabi spoke up.
"So," he said, "raid."
"Oh, r-right," Midoriya turned back around, sending one last shy glance to Hawks. The blond smiled back, more than endeared, and the supporter smiled back.
The world looked so lovely now.

-

Midoriya stared at him and gave him this smile. Hawks felt like, in that moment, he wouldn't mind if the world slowed down just a little bit more.
