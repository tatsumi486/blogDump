### until we bleed
### sat

Izuku felt tired. Seeing an open seat, he sat there, wanting nothing more than to sit down and take a break. Just a minute for him to breath and think around the pulsing pain in his side before they head back out into the fight.
"Take 15 and we'll finish up and head back," Izuku called out, sinking into the seat. His hand came to his side, and he felt the world haze in front of him.
At this point, he realized that there was an uncanny silence between them. Body tense, OFA dancing right underneath his skin, he looked up. Danger Sense wasn't acting up, so for the moment, he was certain that they were okay for this instant.
But in front of him, Aizawa looked like Midoriya had cut his heart out. He furrowed his brow, because Aizawa wasn't someone that wasn't easily affected by anything. If he was-
"Izuku," a voice reverberated from the back of his seat and he turned his head.
When did Enji get so close?
The older man stared at him, eyes wide and jaw clenching. "Are you okay?"
Better question, why did he smell so good?
He blinked slowly, and then suddenly realizing his thoughts, he shot up to his feet. Face paling because he never thought that he would succumb so easily to this filthy body, a wave of nausea washed over him. 
"Sorry, I forgot myself."
"Izuku," Enji's voice was warm, low like a fire sent to shimmer, "You can use me."
Aizawa actually bared his teeth, but he took one look at Izuku before turning on his heel and leaving with a quiet, "Excuse me."
Eyebrows furrowed, sweat beading at his forehead, Izuku's voice was sharp.
"Stay," he said. Aizawa's steps stopped and red eyes, so bright they might as well be glowing met his gaze. Izuku's eyes sharpened, because if there was one thing that pain was good for, it always helped him focus again. "What's... going on?"
"He's... made his [Promise of Intention] through the bite, and since you never rejected him, he classifies above me. I made my Intentions clear, but you never accepted it. It's... It sounds bad, but it's an instinctual thing."
Trying to make sense of alpha hierarchy while his side was bleeding and bruised to hell was a lot harder than he thought.
"I didn't accept anyone," he said.
"You also didn't reject anyone," Aizawa replied back. "Since you're not explicitly giving a heirarchy-"
"The hierarchy is based on my favor?" Izuku hissed out. His temper and incredulity took the forefront of his mind, and forgot himself. The pain laced his side, and his hand came to his side. Enji's jerked, about to get out of his seat and Aizawa flinched like he was barely managing to keep himself in his seat.
"Izuku, maybe you should sit down-"
"Answers," the young man snapped back. The pain ebbed just enough and Midoriya straightened again. "I need answers before I can decide if I can rest."
While it could have been worded better, it was the cold and blunt true. If it was instinct, then he needed to be aware of that so he can double check and make sure that he always acted within the means. He didn't want to make mistakes that could have been easy to avoid. 
"Sit down," Aizawa said, "and we'll explain."
For good measure, Enji stood up and stepped away from the bench. Still, Izuku didn't budge from where he was in the middle of the room. If they thought they could outwait him, they had another thing coming. They would have to cut his legs off if they wanted him to move. 
Taking a deep breath through his nose, Aizawa spoke again.
"Normally, alphas are... territorial," he said, "and have some ambition to stand at the top. So if the Leader of an area is an alpha, even if we know it's right, we challenge it. It's instinct. Once that was over and done with, it settles."
"But we have you," Enji said, "The urge to challenge an omega doesn't exist, the same way we don't challenge betas either."
"Dumb alpha instinct," Izuku said.
Aizawa agreed," Dumb alpha instinct. Obviously, when we came here, none of us were in an state of challenging or fighting or anything. But now," he sighed, "now we're healthy and relatively stable."
"So you're making a heirarchy to calm those instincts," he said.
"And since you aren't choosing anyone-"
"-not that you have to-"
"-we have to find a way amongst each other to make a hierarchy."
And Izuku lifted his arm up, where Enji's bite was still healing.
"So this is the problem."
Aizawa shook his head, "We've always been fighting. This just gives everyone the same target."
"And I can't do anything about it?"
"If you make it indisputable," Enji said, "then the hierarchy could be indisputable, they would go back to fighting amongst themselves instead."
"...How do I do that?"
Aizawa kept his eyes on the ground. Enji looked at the wall. 
"...My side hurts. Hurry up so I can take a break."
Enji snorted and Aizawa shot him an exasperated glance.
"In this case, indisputable would mean your mate. The person that you have choosen."
Izuku felt a headache coming on, and lost in his mounting frustrations, gave a blistering comment. "It's always about that."
"You don't have to do anything," Enji spoke up, eyes bright like the ocean reflecting a sunny summer day's sky. "I can handle this."
"So how do I accept him as a mate?" Izuku said, moving past them to sit down on the chair. He leaned against the back of his chair, a quiet sigh of relief ripped from his mouth as his trembling hands came to his side. No blood, but it was starting to become an ugly shade of purple. He looked back up. "Well?"
"You don't have to do this," Enji said, eyes wide.
Normally, people would look that vulnerable and lost when they were being rejected, but Izuku supposed that there was nothing normal about this situation.
