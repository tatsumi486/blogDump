## sat

Izuku walked into the kitchen, and pretending that he wasn't waiting for him, Fatgum broke into a wide grin and started to beam.
"Good afternoon, Izuku!" he cheered.
The young man took a full step back, eyes taking him warily, and Fatgum pretended not to notice. Instead, he moved back to work, wiping down the pots that they used.
"Help yourself to anything here," he called out, "but if you wait a couple minutes, I think the deer should be done. Lunchrush was really happy with how the sauce came out, so I'm sure it'll be delicious!"
The young man took a bowl on the side. After carefully inspecting it, he grabbed a spoon. With a small amount of rice, he turned to grab the soup. 
And standing there, he tipped his head back and downed it all in three loud gulps. He licked his lips, and cleaned his dishes, turning them over on the side, and then left.
Since the world ended, food was a luxury. The longer time went, the more precious it became. Food was a nessesity, but it was abundant here. They had enough food that no one had to go hungry anymore.
So for Fatgum, who was sick and tired of seeing people be hungry, he worried.

-

"Are you... tasting the food you eat?"
Izuku, who grimaced as he swallowed twice, smacked his chest like it would help him get it down. With a sigh, he waved at them.
"Thanks for the food."
"That can't be good for you."

-

The fire came quick and fast, as fire does, and Izuku ducked under it with practiced ease. He and Enji had fought more than enough times together to know how to avoid his fire-
Until the fire dropped, and Izuku barely reacted in time to slide closer to the ground. A fresh coat of burns painted his arm and back, and his knees and thigh slid painfully against the ground. Rolling away, he jumped back onto his feet and shot up in the air when the gush of fire suddenly launched at him.
He didn't tknow what was worse. The fact that he was facing off a monster who could manipulate fire, or the fact that he felt relief when he realized that it was a monster. 
Izuku would kill this here and now. It didn't matter why. He would kill it, because there was no fire in the world that could hurt him. 
The monster screamed, its fire so hot that heatwaves were starting to radiate off the ground. He needed to wrap it up before someone else got here. Cracking his neck, he pushed aside the pain and all his thoughts.

-

"Izuku!" 
Izuku kicked down the part of the wall as he climbed out. Dropping two bags of supplies that he managed to salvage before the fire consumed the rest of the house, he gave a wave as Enji dropped down next to him. Helping push the rest of the rubble away, the man grabbed him, before Izuku readjusted himself and sent the two of them sprawling towards the ground as something exploded. As natural as ever, Izuku made sure to cover Enji's head, with his body. With a long sigh, he leaned backwards and away from the older man.
The explosion subsided. The ringing in his ears calmed down, and he could hear his heartbeat pounding again. With a long sigh, he felt himself calm down as he stood up.
"How was the other buildings?" he asked the taller man.
"...We're wrapping up. I came here since you weren't answering your walkie, and the house was on fire."
"Ah," Izuku stared at the fire raging on the house, "Yeah. I made a mistake. I figured it out."
"You?" Enji frowned, like the thought that Izuku could make a mistake never occurted to him. It brought him little comfort. 
"Yeah," Izuku nodded, stepping to grab the bags of supplies. It wasn't much, but hopefully they weren't scortched and useable. He turned back to Enji, pulling one of the bags on and felt a dull twinge when it rubbed against his new burns.
The only fire that could hurt him was the fire that was aimed at him. It was a humbling reminder.

"There's no such thing as fate," Stain said, "but if there was, I'd slit her throat for making me wait so long to meet you."
"If we had met before, we wouldn't have noticed."
The older man shook his head, "That's why we call it fate."
"I thought fate didn't exist."
"If it did, I'd cut her."
Izuku opened his mouth, eyebrows furrowed, until he caught the look on Stain's face and the litle smile curling on his face.
"...You're ridiculous."
"Dumb alpha instinct," Stain replied back off-handedly. "I'd do anything for your attention."
"Doesn't that bother you?"
"Maybe if it was someone else," the older man replied, "but I like you."
Izuku blinked, shocked and surprised, and the older man slowly turned around. He took slow steps towards the younger man, as though to give ample enough time and space for the man to stop him. He leaned down, gaze sifting from his lips to his eyes before he spoke slowly.
"Shouldn't you stop me?"
"Maybe..." Izuku hesitated, cheeks a rosy color underneath the moonlight, "if I didn't want it."
Stain chuckled, something as quiet twinkling stars, as he leaned in to kiss his cheeks. A careful brush of chapped lips against the smooth of his cheeks, before he backed away.
"If I do anymore," he said, "I'll lose myself."
"Huh?"
"I want you to want me," the older man replied, turning away. "And until I'm certain that you want me, not my alpha, then," he gave a lazy wave as he walked away.
Izuku blinked back, suddenly alone in the middle of the street. 
"What?"

-

"I'm an omega," Izuku hissed between his teeth, pulling the shapel out of his thigh, "I'm always in distress."

-

"Welcome back! Good work, everyone!" Fatgum called out, waving at them as they came back in, handing out waterbottles. 
Shigaraki paused, and his ears starting to dust pink, he took one of the bottles. "...We're back," he said. 
The beaming grin that the blond returned made his cheeks darken considerably.
"Tch, whatever," he said, and right when he normally would have stalked off, hesitated. He turned back to the larger man, "I didn't take this because I wanted to. I'm just thirsty."
Fatgum's grin remained just as bright and patient.
"Don't look at me like that," the former villain hissed back, twisting open the cap and aggressively chugging it down. 
"You're so damn loud," Eraserhead yawned as he walked in from behind. "Thanks," he said to Fatgum as he tok the water, "You heading out?"
"Yeah, just a perimeter run," he said. "We're going to head out in about an hour."
Eraserhead nodded, "It was pretty quiet out there. Be safe."
"Will do!"
"Could I have a water?" Kirishima asked, waving his hand. He looked about ready to fall asleep on his feet, and he gave a wide grin at the other adults.
"Of course!" Fatgum wasted no time passing it over, "Welcome back Kirishima-kun!"
The young man grinned back, tired and pleased.
"I'm baaaack," he said, yawning, "oops. Sorry."
"Nothing to be sorry about. Go get some rest."
"Yes sir..."
"And don't forget to turn in your grammar homework."
Kirishima groaned back.
"Brutal," Shigaraki muttered.
"Then he shouldn't have signed up for patrols this week," Erasherhead replied back easily, "no one else did."
"We gotta go Plus Ultra," Kirishima replied back, lifting his fist up weakly while Shigaraki snorted. 
"It'd be more admirable if you weren't swaying on your feet," Mirio chirped brightly, "Good morning, everyone!" He greeted the others.
He got a mixed bag of greetings in response, ranging for a bright "Morning, Mirio-kun" to a muted, "yeah, whatever."
"So why are we all here?" he asked, looking around.
"Izuku wanted to call a meeting before morning patrol left," Eraserhead replied back.
"And he's late," Shigaraki said, tone blistering. 
"Twice went out with him," Eraserhead reminded them. "They're bound to run into trouble."
Just then, a blur of something slid right by them. 
"Hah! I am faster!" Miruko snapped back.
Ingenium, skidding on the ground as he came to an abrupt stopped shouted back, "No way, I definately made it here first!"
"Sore loser!" Miruko pointed back, her grin ruthless. 
Eraserhead pinched the bridge of his nose.
A few seconds later, a quiet, "Hey..." came from the gates. With two and a half backpacks, the younger Iida was pitched over his knees. Taking a deep breath, he straightened up, "Why would you just abandon your packs in the middle of the street like that?! Do you know how dangerous that could have been!"
"Tenya, you're my little brother, I'm faster, right?!" Ingenium immediately hounded him.
"Haaa? Don't be biased like that! You're a fair judge, aren't ya Tenya?" Miruko snapped back, rushing for the young man.
"You both are too irresponsible!" the young man exploded out.

-

Any semblance of their annoyance at being kept waiting, and all domestic affairs came to a sudden halt as the stench of blood stated to waft in. Walking in in varying states of injured, but still, walking in, Izuku saw them. 
"Izuku!"
Blood smeared across his face and chest, he raised his arm and waved back.
"This isn't our blood," he said, "Aside from brusing, we're fine. We caught onto a nest underneath the parking garage out west. There were 40 of them there."
"That's... too small then," Ingenium said quietly, understanding what was going on.
"I'll join you guys in twenty minutes," Izuku said, "Once I check on the maps about it."

-

"Please, please, help me."
The man prostated himself in front of them.

"...Alright," Izuku said, "But it'll be on our terms. You understand that, right?"
"Yes... Yes!" the joy was palaple on his face. His grin stretched out as he bowed his head, over and over again, "Thank you, thank you!"
Izuku stared at him for a moment longer, even without turning around, he could feel the increulous stares being thrown his way.
"Just because we go doesn't mean that she'll be alive," he warned. "Take this time to get some water and rest up. We'll leave in 15 minutes." He turned around, already thinking of what he needed to do now and when they get here.
"Wait, wait," Dabi dropped his voice low, eyes sharp as he stared curiously at the young man. "You want to help him? Risk our lives?"
The young man stared at him and then shook his head.
"...You don't have to come," he said. And he looked over at the others, "None of you do."
"...No, no," Dabi's grip tightened on him. "You're going? I'm going. That's it. But why are we going?"
"...If the situation was reversed," he said quietly, "I would have begged for help to see you again too."
Blue eyes widened, and Izuku pulled his arm out of his grip.
"Don't think too hard. And if you have to think so hard about it, then don't come." 

-

"I know that it's awful that all these buildings collasped," Sero said, "but look at that."
Izuku turned to where the sun was setting. Due to the placement of the clouds, soft lavenders intertwined with blushing pinks, dancing across the skyline with the dying light. The stretch of color was beautiful, and for a moment, Izuku could forget about being weak and losing and everything, and take in the beauty of the world.
"Oh wow!" Uraraka said, "I wish I could take a picture."
"Nah," Mina said, grin wide as she stepped up next to her friend, "It's perfect like this. A sunset just for us, you know?"
No matter what broke, the sun with set. No matter who did or did not die, it will rise again. The thought was humbling. 
Izuku stared at the sunset, the beautiful thing it was, and felt something coil tightly inside of him. 
One more thing in the world that, no matter what he does or doesn't do, will be completely unaffected by him. It made him feel powerless.
And at the same time, he wondered if he was getting cocky.
The omega who could stop the sun from setting. Sounded like a bad fanfiction.

-

"I think I get it now," Izuku said. He leaned over, his fingers coming up to gently cup his face.
Aizawa leaned into the touch, in too much pain to do anything other than accepting the given affection. Quietly, he was thankful that Izuku didn't suffer any injuries this time.
"What do you get?" he asked against his palm.
"I don't like seeing you hurt," he said.
Aizawa's eyes widened just a bit. His hand came to hold Izuku's against his face.
"I see," he said, his voice wrought. His eyes closed, and his jaw clenched tightly.

>>> day in the life (2)

4:16 AM

Fingers carded through his hair as he slowly woke up. Blearily, he looked up, mumbling this or that, and he heard a deep chuckle in return.
"Sorry, did I wake you up?"
Webbed fingers traced scaped his scalp to trail down his cheek.
"...Time?" Izuku murmured, lifitng a hand to hold the hand against his cheek.
"Bit past 4. I'm heading out to patrol," Sakamata muttered.
Izuku's eyes opened then, the reminder of the world outside making him alert. All signs of rest gone, the young man propped himself up on his elbows.
"Don't forget to come back," he said.
"Where else would I go?" Sakamata replied back, leaning down for a kiss. It was chaste, since anything longer would keep him in bed for the rest of the day. "See you when I get back."
Izuku nodded back, but sat up. The blanket slid down his body, revealing his scarred body to the dim light of twilight. Sakamata stared for a moment longer, leaning in to bit down on his shoulder. Izuku gave a long sigh through his nose, his hand coming up to the back of his head.
Sakamata dragged his tongue over his new mark, and leaned up to kiss Izuku one more time.
"Get some rest."
And he left.
Izuku laid back on the bed. His exhausted body wanted nothing more to rest against the sheets, but his mind was alert. Swinging his legs over to the side, a dull pain up his backside, he got up and started the day.

6: 22 AM
"Morning," Shigaraki yawned, wrapping his arms around Izuku's middle and kissing the top of his shoulder. Sitting down with the young omega  "Augh, you smell like that whale."
Izuku replied by turning around and pinching his cheek.
"Play nice," he warned before letting him go and returning to where he was reading the previous night's reports.
The man mumbled this and than, dropping his forehead back to his shoulder. He kissed his shoulder blade, a grin stretching across his lips when he felt Izuku shiver. He wrapped his arms a little tighter, all but nuzzling his face against the side of his neck.
"You're affectionate today," he said.
"You're not paying attention to me," the older man murmured back, "And you weren't there when I came back from patrol last night."
Izuku paused, thinking about what he did last night, and his cheeks started to heat up. Even now, he could feel Sakamata's hands trailed up his thighs, gripping his teeth-
"Oi, what are you thinking about?"
"Sorry," Izuku said, turning his face to kiss Shigaraki's forehead. "I uh... retired early last night."
"Yeah, I know," the man replied back, "But I still wanted to see you." 
Chest warm, Izuku placed his hands ontop of Shigaraki's.
"You have until I'm done with the reports."
"Stingy."

8:05 AM
"I'm skipping the last class," Izuku said, "Could you let me borrow your notes afterwards?"
Shouto nodded, "No problem."
"Settle down," Kan said as he walked in, "We're starting homeroom."

11:20 AM
"Ready?"


2:55 PM
"Izuku, let's eat some lunch!" Twice cheered as he walked in with a tray of onigiri and tea. "I'm starved!"
He placed the tray down onto the table and jumped up to sit on it. With a wide grin on his mouth, he stared at the young man expectantly.
"Sounds good," Izuku said, putting his pen in his notebook and closing it. He reached over to grab it for himself, when Twice grabbed his hand.
"Could I... feed you?"
His eyebrows twitched, but staring at the cautiously hopeful look in Twice's eyes, he caved.
"Ah," he said, opening his mouth. 
The joy on Twice's face was palpable. 


### [glory]

Summary: SemiAU. Malos is awakened by a young boy that barely comes up to his chest. His name is Rex, a former salvager with eyes of gold living on the run. 

Alt: Jin know ths will end in a tragedy. He swore this time he would burn and break before his Driver does. 

>

### neverland


"Yeah, you need it, don't you? Medicine."
Rex set his jaw. 
"Don't worry," the man said, a grin on his face, "You will get your product. Salvage for us. To sweeten the deal, we'll even throw in 50,000 gold."
"...Why are you going so far for me?"
"You're Leftarian. For me there isn't a lot of people I can trust with this job to begin with."
Rex stared at his extended hand. It was a shady job, taking him to a place he didn't normally salvage. A place where the currents bend to swallow people alive. It's no wonder that they weren't getting a lot of volunteers but.
He thought about little Lily, who should at least be up to his waist now, but she can't even stand up anymore.
"Alright," he said, taking his hand in a firm handshake.
"Haha, I can't believe your a Salvager with these little hands," the man said. 
Rex yanked his hand back, his spine tingly in how uncomfortrable he just felt.
"Oops. Didn't mean to scare ya," he said, "We're leaving when the sunsets. Don't be late! Go to Melolo for your advance."
Rubbing his neck, Rex figured that if he came back alive to regret it, that would be the best-case scenario.

-

"So I'll be back in three days," Rex said, placing the bag of money on the table. "This should be enough to hold you guys."
"Whoa, whoa," Malos frowned, standing up from where he was lounging on the couch. "I haven't seen you since yesterday and this is the first thing you say to me?"
Rex took a deep breath through his nose, "Sorry," he said. "It's been a lot of jobs since I got back," he said. "But how has it been for you guys? Anyone giving you any trouble?"
Malos stared at Rex, concaved cheeks and bags under his eyes, and crossed his arms over his chest, "Take me with you."
"And me!" Server called out, walking in with a hot towel and a small pie. "Here, the inn-lady said thanks for the help concerning the krabbles."
"Wow!" Rex's eyes shined brightly, "Nice! Her pies are to die for!"
Malos' hand slammed back down on the table, glare harsh, "Don't change the topic."
The brunet scowled back, "I wasn't going to, but I'm hungry. C'mon, there's enough pie for the rest of us."
The door suddenly opened, and Jin walked in.
"I couldn't find him..." his voice trailed as he found Rex. "...I found him."
"Ah, sorry, were you looking for me?"
The man nodded back, "You didn't tell us where you were going."
And Rex, probably exhausted out of his mind. "I... I  didn't think you'd care."
Jin closed the door behind him, leaning against it and efectively cutting off his main choice of exit. Malos gave this long sigh, crossing his arms in front of his chest, and Server made a wounded noise.
"I... what?"
"You're our Driver," Malos said, "Of course we care."
And Rex had that expression on his face.
"...Just say it," the man said, eyes narrowed. His hand rested over his chest, "I can feel it from here. You can't deny that you don't feel it either."
Rex flinched, but he looked down at his lap.
"I... I've seen other Drivers," he said, "I don't... I don't want to be like them. You guys are your own people. Yeah, I'm the one that woke you up, and I'll take responsibility to make sure you guys get integrated into society and stuff, but I'm not. I can't. I don't want to-"
"So you decided to go hard the other way? Leave us floungering in the dark? Lost and confused and convinced that you just didn't want us-"
"Of course I want you!" his voice rang in the room as he got to his feet. "Why wouldn't I want you? You're beautiful and wonderful, amazing and so," he placed his hand over his heart, where the bond seemed to wrap around his heart and pulsate, "so perfect?"
Malos' eyes were wide, before a fond grin stretched on his face.
"You can feel it, right?" he said, tapping his core, "That's how I know too, Rex. You won't be like them."
The words that he had been waiting to hear came much easier than he thought. They wrapped around his head, playing like an earworm, and he felt his eyes burn as hot tears gathered.
"Aw, don't cry," Server said, coming closer with the towel, "Trust us a little. You're not going to hurt anyone like that."
"I'll... hold you to that," Rex said, "That you will tell me if I cross the line. Promise me."
Jin, and Rex didn't even hear him move, kneeled on the other side of him. Bringing up a small hand to his lips, the older man hid his smile against his knuckles although Rex felt it against his skin. A hot blush crawled up his face.
"I will take this vow to stay by your side as your sword and your might, to remain steadfast and protect what's impotant to you until my core ceases with your breath."
"...Huh?"
Jin stood up.
"Tch, you move fast," Malos grunted, standing up. 
He moved to crouch down in front of the wide-eyed and blushing Rex, and gave a wide grin. 
"I'll fight for what you fight for. I'll fight so that you never feel sad. This blade is yours." He grabbed Rex's hand, and pressed a kiss to the inside of his wrist, where his pulsepoint fluctuated at the tender gesture. Malos nuzzled into his hand before he pulled back. "Should have done this from the getgo."
Server's hands grabbed his as he all but shoved Malos away. The blade scowled, but didn't start a fight. And instead backed away.
"Where you go, I go. I want to see the world that you see, fight by your side, and feel your affinity resonate with mine."
Holding Rex's hands to his chest, their bond saturated with his honest feeings of joy and content at meeting a Driver like Rex.
Overwhelmed by the sensation in his heart, Rex shivered. His body trembled under the weight of their tender words, gentle like the wings of a butterfly and warm like the spring sun. 
"Thank you," he said, scrubbing his eyes, "I won't let you down."
"Alright, now where did you say you were going for a day and a half?"
Rex rubbed his chest, where the bond felt particularly warm, and gave a slow exhale. He motioned for them to sit down, and then slowly stared to speak.

-

"Yeah, you're not going alone."
"Is that why you've been running around since we got here?"
Rex nodded slowly.
"Alright," Malos decided, "We're going together."
"But-"
The look he got from his three blades had him recoiling back.
"Okay, okay, fine." 

-

"Oh?"
The man looked from blade to blade and then to Rex. 
"They're all your Blades?"
Rex didn't give him an inch.
"Are we going to go today?" he asked.
"Oooh, touchy," the man laughed, and took a step back, "You know, I'm starting to like you more and more-"
When suddenly, Malos stood in front of him. Staring down with a cold expression, he made his stance clear.
"Oooh!" the man looked absolutely escatic about this, "Like guard dogs!"
Rex turned bakc, lips pulled back into a snarl, when Malos spoke up instead.
"If you get it then," Malos growled, "Step back."
"Touchy! You got some good blades here, Rex-boy!"
Rex bit the inside of his cheek, but his cheeks colored as he nodded.
"I know."
And even though it was a creep, their bond felt fit to burst with how much affection they shared.

-

Malos took a drink of the water, and placed it on the ground. His eyes immediately fell back to Rex, who was looking at him. His Driver blinked twice, cheeks flushing when he realized that Malos caught him staring, and then he gave a shy smile before quickly turning away. From the tips of his ears to his neck, his skin darkened into a lovely shade of pink.
Malos blinked, a grin stretching his lips. He felt almost stupid, for ever thinking that Rex felt anything other than this warm fuzzy feeling for him.
"If you love me that much," Malos said, lightheaded at the warmth of someone else's adoration filling their bond, "come over here."
Rex slowly turned back around. Cheeks a dark red, he gave the older man a suspicoius glare.
He wondered if it was because Rex was so young. Of course, everyone was young compared to Malos. But maybe it was because Rex was so fundamentally honest that he couldn't lie even when it hurt him so. It was a thought that surfaced once in a while, because Malos had lived so long and had never quite felt like this before. 
A love that was unique to the people that managed to meet someone as bright and as beautiful as-
"Oh my god," Rex's hands came up to his ears, "I love you too, I get it. Shut up. It's so embaressing!"
Malos blinked.
"Did you ... hear that?"
Rex, face bright red, nodded. "Yes. I get it. Sh!"
Malos, the Blade of Destruction, felt his face grow hot. A blush crawled up and across his face.
"Stay out of my head!" he snapped back.
"Stay out-" Rex spluttered back. "You were talking so loudly!"
"I didn't say any of that aloud. I said things like that in my head! If I talked about how cute you are everytime I thought it, we'd never get anything done!"
At the admission, the both of them were flushing harder. Rex buried his face into his hands. 
"What are you guys doing?" Server asked, his gaze absolutely withering.
"Malos is trying to blame me for things I didn't do!" Rex shouted, at the same time Malos shouted.
"Rex is reading my mind against my head!"
"...Normally I would take Rex's side," Server admitted, "Because really? He read your mind?" 
Rex crossed his arms over his chest, jutting his chin out in victory while Malos scowled at him.
"But I was here the whole time," he said, "...Rex, Malos didn't say anything until you guys started yelling."
"So... So you're saying I can read his mind? Like a telepath?" Rex made a face, "How do I stop it?"
"I'm saying that it's possible..." Server trailed off. He stared at Rex, then at Malos, and then back. 
He wished that Malos would hurry up and leave, so that he could have a moment with their Driver for himself. He wanted to kiss him slowly, take off his clothes and push him down onto the bed. Or maybe Malos could stay, stand on the side and gnash his teeth instead while Rex gave quiet pleas for more-
"Oh my god! No!" Rex snapped back. His face was an alarming shade of red. "Server, not you too!"
"...Did you hear any of that, Malos?"
Malos frowned, eyebrows furrowed. "Damn," he said.
"You mean..."
"I guess we can... send our thoughts to you?"
"Please don't," Rex said. He shook his head, "Is this... Is this a Driver thing?"
"
