# what

>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

Deku took his helmet off and Enji turned around to say something, probably to talk about what their next steps should be, but instead what came out was, "Go rest. You look like shit."
The young man turned to him, eyebrows furrowed like he was confused, like he didn't know or understand why Enji would take on look at his face and say that.
"Endeavor-san," Ingenium admonished.
"I will," Deku replied. Once he gets these reports in-
"Leave the reports to me, and go rest."
The young man stared at him, and Enji paused too.
"...Will you join me?"
Behind them, somewhere, Ingenium choked and Spinner gave this strangled sound.
Enji stared, his eyes wide and his jaw unhinged.
"I..." he cleared his throat, "I can work something out."
"Oh jesus fucking christ," Burning scowled, "Just go."

"Izuku-"
Hawks dropped down next to him, expression pensive as he passed a small trailmix towards him.
"-You gotta eat something."

# kind nightmare

"That's just fucking bullshit," Dabi said, leaning his head against Midoriya's shoulder. "You'd forget a good guy for doing a bad thing but you can't forget a bad guy doing a good thing, huh?"
He was quiet for a second and his hands came around Midoriya's waist to pull him closer. Midoriya stiffened, figuring that he was going to hurt or forced again, but instead, Dabi just held him close.
"Shit," he said, "What am I supposed to do so that I become a good person in your eyes? Then, no matter all the dumb shit I did before, you'd forgive me, right?"
He gave a long sigh. His breath tickling Midoriya's skin.
"I don't have a time machine," he said. "I didn't think I'd ever have something like this?"
"...Something like what?" Midoriya asked, truly curious.
Dabi pulled back, staring at Midoriya for a moment and then laughed.
"How cruel," he said, "You're going to pretend you don't know?" He leaned in for a kiss, and Midoriya leaned back. "You're really starting to hurt my feelings."
And Midoriya didn't get it.

Shigaraki paused. He leaned against 

-

"Because that's the thing about heroes!" Shigaraki shouted out, voice hoarse and expression scrunched into something painful, "You all just leave! You selfish bastards! You never think about the ones who have to wait for you!"
And this bitter laugh came out of Shigaraki, like something inside of him was fundamentally broken, and it translated all his tears into those broken sounds.
"You know what it's like, don't you? To wait for someone that won't come home?"
Midoriya stiffened and Shigaraki's lips turned into a cruel smile.
"So why are you doing that to me? Hey, how come you're the hero in this relationship? If I ruin it, if I make sure that you can't be a hero, that means you'll be mine, right? That you'll come back to me?"
What makes a person bad? What makes a person good? The things that Midoriya watched on the screen as a child, cheered and cried about, didn't feel so cut-clear anymore. As a hero, who was he protecting? What was he protecting? Midoriya didn't know. He wasn't certain anymore.
Shigaraki hovered over him, "Midoriya," he said. "Why can't I hate you?"

"...I am," Midoriya said, "Scared of being alone."
Endeavor stood next to him, his watching the small smile on Midoriya's face as he stared at the flowers at his feet. The older man, very gently, lifted his hand to his head. The young man jolted at the touch, peering up at him with wide eyes.
A small smile stretched his lips.
"I... fear spring," he admitted. 
"Spring?" Midoriya, the silly human that barely came up to his chest, parroted. 
"...I feared its warmth."
"...I see," Midoriya nodded. "I think I get that."
Which was a shame, because Endeavor wished he didn't. 

# late night detours

"Where were you?" Aizawa finally asked. He rested his head on Midoriya's shoulder, his hands and forearms flat against the wall on either side of the young man. Like this, he wondered, would Midoriya stay? Would he decide to never leave again?
"There was something I had to do," Midoriya replied, his voice quiet but gentle and it made his heart grow restless.
"And you're going to leave again?"
There was no response.
Was it better that Midoriya didn't lie? Of course not. Aizawa was a liar, so he would know. He played around, so he would know. He lived with himself everyday of his damn life, and he knew. 
"Just lie," he said, his voice breaking. "Lie to me. Tell me you'll stay."
Tell me I'm worth staying for.
Midoriya's small hands came to his shoulder.
"I'm sorry," he said, but Aizawa knew he didn't mean it. 


# Returning a gift

11:10 PM. 
An insignificant timestamp for an insignificant moment. Truly, it was actually pretty gross that there were two grown men holding hands like this, but Twice's hand was warm. Swinging their conjoined between the two of them, he hummed a quiet melody.
The street that they walked on was deserted, save for hte two of them. As though the world wanted to preserve this moment for them as well, the streetlights above them flickered before turning off. Further down the street, where this street meets the main intersection, there was light. 
As they made their way down, Twice's hand squeezed his and he gave a gasp as he checked his phone.
"Oh!" Twice explained, "It's 11:11!" he said, "Make a wish!"
His tone was so bright that Midoriya didn't even notice the flickering streetlight finally die. The world was plunged into darkness, and the soft starlight failed to reach all the way down to them. A shame. The world would be a brighter place with Twice's grin.
"Hm," he smiled, "What did you wish for?"
"Midoriya," Twice said, voice grave, "If you say your wish aloud, it won't come true."
Midoriya thought about a childhood chasing after capes, and privately agreed.
"But!" Twice's voice stopped, and it dropped down to a quiet level. It was almost as soft as the starlight above, as though it was a secret from the whole world. "You know, I wouldn't mind doing this again."
Midoriya's heart skipped at beat.
"It'd be nice. Just, living. We can just, be ourselves. Have some time for ourself. Even though it feels like we're standing in the middle of a horror movie, I don't know. Feels sorta romantic."
Midoriya felt his hand get squeezed.
"I'd like that."
Midoriya's wish was different from Twice's, or anything he's ever wished before. Because Midoriya did not trust anyone with it. A future that he carved out with his own hands. A path that he'd claw his way to.
Midoriya wanted to make someone else's dream come true.
"Me too," Midoriya said, Twice's warmth settling around his heart. "I'd like that too."
11:18 PM.
This insignificant moment would decide the rest of Midoriya's life.

Midoriya leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. He used to hate coming to the hospital, but now, he didn't feel anything at all. Maybe everyone was wrong, and the person that he had fooled the best was himself.
He didn't love his mom. He didn't love his dad. Maybe that was why he didn't feel anything. It didn't actually matter to him, and he was the same as the scum that he had surrounded himself with. He...
His phone buzzed.
He looked down.
A message from Twice. Asking if he wanted to change out their weekly movie from their rom-com to a horror one instead. He stared at it and couple just see Twice in his mind's eye, palms pressed together and a pleading tone from his lips, his extra voice betraying him and letting him know that he wanted to hold Midoriya close under the guise of being scared. 
Midoriya leaned his forehead against the edge of his cell phone. Maybe there was another reason why he wasn't crying. Maybe he wasn't crying because he knew that there was something he had to do. It wasn't over yet. He didn't have the luxury to cry right now.
Thinking of a warm hand on a night where even starlight couldn't reach them, Midoriya remembered what was important to him.
