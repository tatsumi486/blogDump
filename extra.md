### way back home

Hikage Shinomori (Danger Sense) ->  a cowardly mangaka who's afraid of everything. meets Midoriya at the hospital (dad is unwilling to get treatment and wants to go die on his farm not here and Midoriya changes his mind). Eventually inherits the farm and invites midoriya.
Shun - > Banjo Daigoro (Recovery Girl's Stray) -> will end up taking over the candy store.
En (smokescreen) -> some random tourist? Really shady connections to mainland China (according to Chisaki)

"Yeah, I wouldn't have guessed that they were related at all," Toyomitsu laughed. "Pretty impressive, in that sense, Midoriya."
Midoriya smiled back, "They don't have to share a name to be related."
Shigaraki's spoon clinked the bowl and he stared at the young man in front of him.
"Oh? Then, will you adopt me?" he asked, cheeky grin and all.
"I'll be honored to," the young man replied. "In your inaguration, you can do the dishes."
"Ouch, that's cold Midoriya."
Midoriya's smile was sweet, and Toyomitsu was doing the dishes before he left.

Bakugo blanched when he saw the test scores. He looked at it, and then to Kirishima, and grabbed him by his hair.
"What the hell is in here?!" he shouted, "How'd you fuck up this badly? Did you even try?!"
"I'm sorry!" Kirishima yelled back. "But that's why I'm asking for help!"
Midoriya nodded back, "We're going to the family diner to study after this," he said. "Do you want to come with us?"
"Wait, is this an open session!?" Kaminari yelled out, running forward, "Me too! Please, take me too!"
Quietly, Koda shyly raised his hand.
"If it's a group this big, it might be better to do it at someone's house," Tokoyami pointed out, sliding into the seat next to Midoriya. He gave a meaninful look towards Iida, who straightened at the wordless invitation.
"Then, as the Class Representative, I would like to extend an invitation to all of you!"
"Whoa! As expected of the Volunteer Class Rep!" Kirishima clapped.
"Always looking out for us!" Sero cheered.
"He's so reliable!" Kaminari added.
Iida looked like he was about to burst from the compliments. 
"Of course! I am happy to help my friends!"
There was a brief pause and Tsuyu poked her head into the conversation.
"Is this a boys-only thing?"
"Of course not," Iida announced, "it's for anyone who wants to pursue knowledge!"
"Eh, so it's fine if I come, right?" Shinso asked, sliding the door open. "Hope you have a big enough place to house all of us."
Iida nodded, "I will not let you down!"

[when midoriya's hospitalized and everyone learns that his arm's out of commission]
[on his way out, saves Hikage's life from some thugs in the back]

His shoulder would never heal. Midoriya wasn't a stranger to permament damage or anything, but this wasn't his body. To begin with, it didn't make sense that he could give this body an injury that would never heal while trying to save someone.
But Deku-kun, who went through god knows what, had a few scars. Maybe it was the world trying to tell him that his life was a mess. 
But what scared Midoriya the most was how happy it made him feel. It was permament. It was the irrefutable proof, that even if he went back to his world, he did this. This was something he did. 
Wasn't that dispicatable? If (when) he returned, he would need to turn in his Hero Liscense. He clearly wasn't a hero. If all it took for him to break out of that "Hero Ideal" was a new location, then he wasn't a hero at all. 
Passing an alleyway, he found the usual picture. A group of six men ganging up on the last. The man was on the ground.
So what if he kept this hero facade up a little more? Why can't he lie a little longer? What's wrong with it? It's not like there were any heroes here.
Arm in a sling, he stepped into the alleyway and called out.
"If you need six people to beat up one," he said, "then I guess he must be really strong."
It wasn't what a hero would say. Because Midoriya wasn't a hero. 

-

He stared in clear disbelief as Hikage, just a little younger than he remembered, slowly picked his head up. 
"Who... are you?" he asked.
Midoriya stared at him, mouth slowly coming agape.
"Wait, watch out-"
And one of the men that fell came back with a 2x4 and shattered it against his head. It might have knocked someone else, but Midoriya just turned around. 
Staring at him, Midoriya spoke quietly.
"You aren't going to win this fight. Go get first-aid for your friends."
The man stared at him, and took a step back.
"M-Monster..."
He stared for another moment and then smiled.
"Yeah," he said quietly, "That sounds more accurate."

-

"You see," Hikage said, leaning back in his seat, "My quirk is "Danger Sense." It helps me discern dangerous situations."
Midoriya stared at him, unable to tell him that he was intimately aware of that, and took a drink of his water instead.
"And from the moment I met you, it rang like crazy."
His hands trembled on the mug his was holding, and he stared at Midoriya.
"But you saved my life. So I..."
"It's okay," Midoriya said, cutting him off. "It's enough for me that you're okay. You don't have to push yourself."
Was confidence something he never had? Was confidence something that he got because he was a hero? The thought made him feel a little lonely. The quirk that saved Midoriya's life plenty of times was probably an awful burden on a regular someone else. 
Which was funny. To think that he'd ever refer to a former OFA-Holder as a 'regular someone else'.
He stood up, his stomach churning. 
That quirk, that told him when villains were enroaching and that told him that a civilian was being threatened, that quirk was now alerting someone that he was a danger. He couldn't imagine whatkind of headache that they ere receiving, and still, he wanted to meet Midoriya?
That kind of courage was heartening. It made Midoriya remember what he's fighting so hard for.
A hand grabbed his wrist, and the teen jerked. He didn't break out of his grip, and lost his words when he looked up and caught his gaze. Hikage's fingers trembled, and his face was deathly pale.
"But I know you're not a bad person," he said. "I didn't... I always thought that dangerous people were bad. But if you were bad, you wouldn't have helped me, right? No recognition, and no reward, you're-"
"-just a thug," Midoriya cut him off. Just someone that only knows how to talk with my fists. I-"
The grip on his hand tightened.
"Thank you," Hikage interupted again. "For saving me."
"I..."
"When you appeared," Hikage continued, "It was like a scene from a manga! Like... the unlikely hero came to save the day, kind of feeling. I...I-I think I get it now."
Midoriya's eyes widened because no one could have ever prepared him for the next thing that Hikage said.
"I want a protagonist like you!"

-

"Occasionally, I meet a crazy bastard like you," En laughed. "A guy that makes my heart pound and my blood rush."
Midoriya, who had thought that this was an En that came to Japan and never learned Japanese, felt his stomach coil. Wasn't it better that he never heard his voice speak the language he remembered, and that they never had to meet at all if this was how they had to meet?
"When I was first called into Japan, it was because our entire operation here went belly-up. We waited for the pigs to roll somewhere else, and hopped on over to see what happened. You have no idea how upset the bosses were about this! But we couldn't afford failure, so here I am!" he sounded far too happy for a man saddled with a responsibility he didn't want.
Midoriya never had a chance to learn Chinese. He knew phrases and a handful of charactes, but he knew less than the average second-grader. However, he remembered seeing the Chinese strokes and notes before he had to leave. It couldn't be...
"Imagine my shock when I learned that it was some high school brat was the reason why everything crashed and burned. I just had to meet you."
Midoriya stared at him, wary, and En tilted his head. 
"Someone who doesn't flinch when a foreigner approaches him. Who didn't hesitate to help a stranger out and make sure that they get around town. A stranger who could barely understand the person they're helping. Same stranger came running in after my supposed kidnapping into an abandoned warehouse. I would call it reckless but..." he made a motion to the mess of people on the ground. 
Midoriya grimaced. It felt like everyone in this world had a way with words that made him sound like a total loon. But how else could he explain it, other than that he thought that the En needed help?
"Thank you, truly, for coming to save me," En continued, one hand behind his back and his other hand coming forward. "Now, let's fight."
The people in this world only understood one thing.
Midoriya took his jacket off and prepared himself. 

-

"Are... you okay?"
En woke up, a cold compress on his forehead and Midoriya's worried gaze looking down on him. 
"...You hit hard," En said. "Your quirk... Is it strength?"
He shook his head. 
"I see, then, is it... some mind ability? Maybe mind-read? Or predicting the future?"
Green eyes looked to the groundas he backed away.
"I'm quirkless," he said, getting up to his feet. He dusted hmself off, and extended a hand to the taller man, "Do you think you can get up?"
"Yeah, thanks," En said, taking his hand. His hand engulfed Midoriya's, and when he stood up, didn't let go.
"P...Please let go," Midoriya tugged on his hand.
"Hm, I don't want to." En smiled, "Guys like you are once a lifetime. What are your plans for the future, do you want a job with me? I'll take care of you for life."
"No, thank you," Midoriya said, "I'm not going to agree to a job that I might not be qualitifed for."
"There's nothing in the world you're unqualified for. You got the most important part," En replied, "Smart and strong. Compassionate and sucessful."
Midoriya looked like he was going to be sick. It made En chuckle. 
"Here's my card," he said, "Even if you decide not to spend the rest of your life with me, let's be allies."
"What if I want to be strangers?"
En actually laughed, a sound that made him sound like he could fly, before he answered.
"Then you shouldn't have ever given me directions."

-

Midoriya blanched. "What?"
"Yeah, he transferred into class with me," Daiboro replied, "You know him?"
"You're a middle schooler?" Midoriya gasped, hand coming to his face.
With a bow, En beamed back up at him. "And starting next year, I'll be your Kouhai!"

### limited collection

Dabi woke with a start. Suddenly alert, he looked from left to right and then back again. Cold sweat broke out from his brow and down his back as he looked around wildly. There was something wrong. There was something seriously wrong but he couldn't place it. 
"Dabi, you're up already?"
Blue eyes jumped to Midoriya's figure, and he felt the swirling anixeity come in and focus into one point. He stared for a moment and then sighed.
"Bad dream?" Midoriya asked.
Dabi stared back and shrugged. It wouldn't be wrong, he supposed. He didn't even realize when he stopped being used to solitude.
"...What are you up to?" he asked, voice gruff from sleep. 
Midoriya's face darkened, and he looked away. In his hand, he was holding a horned rabbit by the ears. 
"I couldn't sleep," he said, "so I went on a walk. I caught breakfast though."
"Oh, are you going to make the stew?" Dabi asked.
Midoriya's eyes, if at all possible, seemed to grow brighter.
"I can."
Dabi hummed back, feeling as though he had revealed too much about himself. Dragging his eyes away from him, he looked back to their dead fire. There wasn't any warmth left, as though it hadn't been burning so brightly when they had settled in.
"Sounds good."
Midoriya shuffled towards him, a cheeky grin on his face as he sat down next to him with the rabbit. He leaned against his shoulder.
"Sorry I wasn't here when you woke up," he said.
"I don't care," Dabi replied. 
"I really wanted to be the first thing that you saw this morning," he said. 
"...Really?" he tilted his head to the side, and Midoriya gave him a big grin.
"We don't have a house or anything right now, but it sorta feels like it's home when you say "Good morning" to the same person you say "Good night" to, right?"
Dabi wouldn't know, actually, but Midoriya wouldn't know that.
"Good morning, Dabi," he said. "It looks like today will be a beautiful day, too." He got up, probably intending on starting breakfast, when Dabi found his voice.
"Morning," he said. Pointedly, he looked away from Midoriya's bright gaze as he covered his face and spoke ever quieter. "Good... morning."
An hour before sunrise, Dabi felt his face burn as Midoriya giggled behind his hands.
He'd get back at Midoriya for this later. Taking advantage of him when he's still groggy from sleep. 
The realization that he couldn't remember what he dreamed about would come at a later time.

### believe a liar

Supposedly, soulmates are decided by the universe for you. Supposedly. It made Midoriya's heart waver, because there was no clear cut answer for what a soulmate was. Was he supposed to think that all these different people were his 'missing pieces' or whatever?
What a load of bull. At that point, the better question would be to ask would be, "what were the pieces he had?" How many missing pieces did a person have? At that point, didn't it make more sense to say that he wasn't even a person? 
But that trail of thought led to even more dangerous thoughts.
He covered his face.
Back up, take a breath. The decision he was about to make was going to ruin someone. He needed to make the correct decision, not the one that made him feel good. Between eternal summer blues and dawn's vibrant reds, a pull on his heart and the pain in his gut, he had to make a choice. 
Thinking of it like that, he felt like it was easy. The only person, people, he could be with were the ones that wouldn't break because he did. 
Therefore, Yamada-sensei and Aizawa-sensei were the right option. They lived without him just fine before. They would be fine without him too. It would be fine. He curled a little tighter around himself, and wondered what he would need to do to express his gratitude to them.
