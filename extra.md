### gentle nightmare

- former slave!Midoriya with a single-passenger plane crashlands in "No Man's Land" // "Dark Continent" where he finds massive things & people with quirks & demon-magic stuff 
- Midoriya wakes up on an island filled with monsters. Finds a harem of monsters that sorta look human. Which would be fine except he's as human as they came.
- people who used to be people but lost themselves to their 'demon' self, but wanna be human again (limited) ie become vizards lolol
- people who are fine being monsters/demons & all ie epsada
- Midoriya murdered everyone on the way out, confused and a little relieved that people don't know what the mark on his back is
- idk if i want ppl to come hunt him  down

[au to that emissary au]

-

The Dark Continent. The Nation of Savages and Dark Magic. It was on the tinge of hell, because only the dark, disgusting and dangerous could possibly survive in that kind of abyssal terror. 
In that area that only came in horror stories and children fairy tales, Midoriya staked hope. 
The chain on his ankle was heavy, but nothing was holding him back anymore. Hands caked in blood, Midoriya pulled and yanked at the consoles. It was one of the only ones like it in the world. 
It was his ticket out of here. It was his last Fuck You to the person that burned their mark onto his back.
"Get him!"
His mark burned. Slave Magic was strong, but Midoriya was far too desperate to turn back now. 
"Get that fucking slave!"
And Midoriya took off.

-

The last thing Midoriya remembered before his plane suddenly tipped off and crashed was that the Dark Continent didn't look dark at all.Instead, it looked beautiful. The amber lights of a bright sunshine touched down and it felt like everything bathed in its light glowed and shimmered and shined.
Or maybe it was because this was the first sunset after he was freed.
Maybe the world was just more beautiful now that he was free.

-

By the time he woke up, Midoriya was over a branch. He groaned, pain shooting up through his body and around. Vaguely, he remembered crashing. 
Midoriya stared at the person in front of him. 

-

"...Have you been throwing up like this the whole time?" Aizawa  asked, eyes sharp.
Midoriya shook his head. And after a few seconds, he looked up at him.
"I-I'll clean this up," he said.
Aizawa's expression didn't change, but his voice softened, "That's not what I asked you. C'mon, I'm going to take you to Recovery Girl."
"N-no, it's okay. I-I'm fine."
"Come with me," Aizawa's hard voice left no room for protest.

-

Recovery Girl calmly folded the curtain behind her shut and made a motion for the people who had congregated at the entrance to follow her down the hall. After passing another tent, she whipped around to Aizawa and as calmly as possible, demanded, "What the hell do you think you're doing to him?"
Aizawa arched an eyebrow, and that seemed to be enough to set her off.
"He should have seen me a week ago. His ribs are broken. They have been broken, you can tell. I cannot believe that you've been making him work with the others like that. Are you insane? This could have been healed without any extra recovery time, last week. I'm keeping him for the next two days to make sure he doesn't have any other lingering problems."
Aizawa frowned, "He never said anything."
"Never? You never thought that he was a little more tired? A little out of breath? A little weak?"
No, no, Aizawa had heard all of those things, had thought all of those things.
"You can't just beat someone up and then drop them off to me only when they're dying," she stressed. Her temper flared, eyes sharp until she took in the expression on Aizawa's face. "...You truly didn't know?"
Wordlessly, he dropped his gaze to the ground, thinking hard of all the times he's interacted with Midoriya. 
"...I see," Recovery Girl gave a long sigh.

-

"Is that the kind of person you think I am?" he asked quietly. "Did you think that I wouldn't care, or that I cared more about the how it looked?"
Midoriya shook his head quickly, "No, no, I know you're kind. Someone who always listens patiently to people, offer to help out, and would wordlessly go to stragglers to make sure they can keep up."
"Alright, then why did you tell me that you'll clean it up? You think that's what I wanted to hear?"
Midoriya blinked and suddenly shot up to his feet. Aizawa straightened, in surprise and in mild alarm because didn't Midoriya have three broken ribs? With the way the young man stood, ramrod straight, he would have never thought that he was injured.
"I-I'll go clean it up right now!"
"Midoriya. Sit down."
The confusion filtered through his eyes, and slowly, Midoriya did as he was told. Aizawa rubbed his face, unsure how to even start with this man. Why was he like this? He almost wanted to ask, where did he come from? How did he grow up? Aizawa didn't believe for a second that he didn't remember, but now he was starting to think that he didn't want to remember.
"I'm... I'm not going to yell at you. Or lecture you. If you're injured, I would like you to worry about that more."
"I'm not injured."
Aizawa bit back a harsh quip, but then he caught eye of the near-desperate gleam in his eyes.
"...Alright," he said, "but if you ever feel like your body isn't listening to you, or you feel pain, it's okay. You can come to me."
From the look on Midoriya's face, he might as well be speaking another language. He would just have to keep a better eye on him instead.

-

Midoriya's gaze trailed the bandages around his arm. No question and no hesitation, he was wrapped up and carefully taken care of. His eyes welled as an unfamilar warmth started to well up in his chest. His lips twisted into a lopsided smile as his not-as-injured arm came to the neat bandages on his arm. He couldn't help it, and a quiet laugh slipped out of him. "Haha, wow..."
A hand came to his head, and Midoriya looked up to where Toyomitsu gave a big frown.
"You get hit in the head, too?" he asked, eyes worried as his hands gently ruffled through his hair and push through his curls, checking for any lingering injuries. "No more bumps than before..." he muttered to himself.
A small smile stretched across Midoriya's face as he placed his hands on top of Toyomitsu's and grinned up at the man.
"I'm okay," he said, a wide grin on his face. "Thank you."
Toyomitsu blinked twice, before he gave just as a wide grin back, "No problem! But you know, be a little more careful."
Toyomitsu pulled the young man closer, resting their foreheads together for a moment.
"Please, just a little bit more careful."
Midoriya basked in his warmth for a moment longer, until the man pulled back. They shared another grin.
"I'll try."
But Midoriya remembered a time when his wounds would get so infected that his Master figured that he should be tossed out to die because it was cheaper to buy a new slave than take care of the ones he had. A bit in a daze, Midoriya placed his fingers on the bandages again. 
This was irrefutable proof that he was really free. That he was worth keeping alive. It was no question that he would be treated and there would be an effort to repair him because it wasn't profitable.
In these moments, it really hit him. He was free.
Behind him, Toyomitsu shot him another look.
"Okay, you're really starting to freak me out," he said, coming back to sit next to him. "What's on your mind?"
"I..." Midoriya's voice broke, which made no sense, because he was happy and he was relieved, but his voice came out like he was still broken. "I just can't believe it, I guess," he said, his eyes watering. "I didn't... I didn't think that anyone would care."
Toyomitsu stared at him for a moment longer, and understanding that this was a wound that the eyes couldn't see, wrapped an arm around Midoriya's shoulders. Pulling him closer, he squeezed just a little when the body trembled.
"N-no, I'm fine, really," Midoriya said, his hands clutching at his shirt. "I'm fine-" his voice broke and his tears fell, "I don't... I don't get why I can't stop-"
Toyomitsu's hand came to his head, and he rubbed Midoriya's back with his other hand.
"It's okay," he said. "I have you, and I'll have you for as long as you want me to."
Midoriya would never know, but Toyomitsu solemnly swore that if he ever got a chance to see the Splintered Continent, he would ruin the person that did this to Midoriya.

-

"If you want to keep my cot warm," Shigaraki said, an easy grin on his face and his eyes raking down Midoriya's figure and then back up, "I'll take care of you for the rest of your life."
Midoriya's eyebrows furrowed, but he didn't take a step back. Shigaraki's grin widened a little more, like this was a great thing, and he took a step closer. 
"I won't let you regret it," his voice dropped in pitch as he took another step closer to Midoriya.
The young man met his gaze evenly, just a bit wary. 
"What do you think?"
"It's not what I want. And if that means I won't be taken care of for the rest of my life, I think that's okay."
Shigaraki's grin quickly turned upside down. He tilted his head and spoke simply.
"If I kill you right now, you won't get what you want."
Midoriya's eyes shined, "Then you don't know what I want."
The man took a step back, "If you're looking for death, I can do that for you."
"I'm not looking for death," Midoriya replied, "but I'm not scared of it."
"Then what are you scared of?"
Midoriya stared at Shigaraki and then grinned like he knew a funny joke that the older man wouldn't know.
"Everything!"
Shigaraki's eyebrows furrowed, but at that second, several screaming sounded from outside of their hut. 

-

"Alright then, I'll corrupt you," Shigaraki said, "Then you will have no choice, and you will need me."
Midoriya blinked twice, and then gave a small laugh. Immediately, Shigaraki's malicious grin twisted down. Did he hit the human so hard? He didn't want to break him, just corrupt him. 
"What's so funny?"
"No, it's not funny," Midoriya agreed, "I just... thought that it would be kind of you to make sure that I wouldn't be alone." He gave this breathless laugh, "and that was funny to me. That I could find kindness even here."
Shigaraki and Twice exchanged a look of mirrored confusion. 
"I... what the hell did they do to you?" Shigaraki asked, so personally offended that someone would ever call him and his actions kind, concussion or not.
"Everyone here is so kind," Midoriya murmured, and after a few seconds, was nodding off to sleep.
"...Did he just fall asleep?" Twice asked. 

-

"Alright then," Dabi said, "let's see their prized human."
And without further ado, the Twices on either side of Midoriya tore his flimsy shirt off. Inwardly, he mourned the loss, and wondered how he would explain this to Hakamata, should they ever meet again. 
He stared at the bright blue fire emitting on Dabi's hand, momentarily enchanted by the beauty of the blue. 
"Wow," he whispered, because it was the same blue as his eyes.
The fire died quickly though, and next to him, Twice made this sound.
"What... the hell did they do to you?"
Midoriya blinked and looked down at himself. He felt confused. This was a slave's body, through and through. It was stranger that one as incompetent as Midoriya still had all his digits and limbs anyways.
"Is that what they told you?" Dabi said.
Oh, how much of that did Midoriya say aloud? His head still felt fuzzy.
"Isn't it obvious?" Midoriya replied back, because the strange part was that someone cared.
Dabi stood up.
"I wanted a toy, not someone's broken and chewed up trash."
And Midoriya blinked before he gave a smile.
"...Thank you, Dabi."
Blue eyes looked at him, dropped to the mess on his chest, and then left. 
"He's nicer than he lets on," Midoriya said.
"No, it's that gross," Twice said, eyeing Midoriya's chest.
"Does it still hurt?"
Midoriya shook his head. "Not anymore."
There used to be times when he would wake up in cold sweat, crying and suffocating, but not so much anymore. Carefully, Twice tried to cover him back up by laying his ripped shirt back over his chest. It was rather sweet, all things considered.
He tilted his head to the side, eyeing one of the clones, "What about you?"
His hand flew up to his forehead. "None of your business."
At the same time, the clone on the other side blurted out, "It's ugly and I hate it."
They glared at each other, "Would it kill you to shut your mouth?"
"What's he gonna do? Make you uglier?"
"This face is your face, you idiot!"
"Don't call yourself an idiot!"
And Midoriya watched, fascinated.
"Stop staring!" they shouted at him together, unison in one thing.
"Ah, sorry about that," he replied back. 

-

Twice was in the middle of uncuffing him, just so that he would look a little more comfortable because Twice was uncomfortable looking at him and there was no other reason why he wanted to run his fingers against soft, warm skin. While doing so, he jerked backwards in shock because green eyes were open and aware, staring at him.
"Oh my god!" he gasped. "Say something if you're awake! // Go mute for all I care!"
And Midoriya chuckled back.
"Aren't you... going to escape?" he asked.
Green eyes blinked at him and titled his head, "Wouldn't that get you in trouble?"
"Shouldn't you worry more about yourself?"
Midoriya, and seriously what were humans made from these days, gave a shrug.
"I think they'll hurt you more for losing me than they will hurt me for trying to escape."
Which was fair but.
"Why does that mean anything to you?" Twice asked, unable to stop himself because he couldn't remember the last time someone was considerate moreorless did he remembe the last time he used that word.
But Midoriya looked at him, confused like he didn't understand the question or why Twice was asking it.
"I mean, I'm keeping you here. We are keeping you here, chained up and we're not going to be treating you very well. Don't you want to return to the guys you were with?"
"...Yeah, I do," Midoriya nodded his head, "And I don't like you guys very much either."
Twice placed his hand over his chest, because he felt this stabbing pain so suddenly.
"But that doesn't mean I want to hurt the one person who has been kind to me."
"What? I'm not nice!"
Midoriya smiled back, and it was like someone was slowly pouring sunlight onto the ground, just on Twice.
"Thank you for moving my arms, this is a lot more comfortable."
"I didn't do it for you!" he snapped back, "It was because I was uncomfortable looking at you!"
And feeling a surge of something inside of him, he turned around and left in a hurry. There was no point in arguging with an idiot afterall. 

-

"Are... you sure you're okay?"
Midoriya stared at Aizawa, wonder shining in his eyes as he looked at him.
"Huh?" The words registered and he gave a nod, "Yeah, yes! I'm okay?"
"It's not a trick question," Yamada said from the other side, worriedly looking over their human. 
"No, I am fine," he said, waving his hands in front of him. "Really!"
Aizawa placed his hand on Midoriya's wrist, and the human winced.
"Yeah. I'm sure," he deadpanned back. "...What did they do to you?"
"Just tie me up and stuff," he said, pulling his wrist back, "nothing bad."
"Tying you up isn't bad?" Yamada asked from the other side of him.
In response, Midoriya shrugged back. 
"It could be a lot worse. It wasn't really like they were out to hurt me either. If they wanted to hurt me, I think they would have done something much worse. Not saying that what they did was a good thing, but just that it wasn't the worst thing."
He gave a toothy grin.
"And it wasn't like I was sitting there waiting for death. Thank you for coming for me."
Aizawa and Yamada stopped in their steps, and once he realized that he was walking alone, Midoriya stopped too.
"Of course we came for you," Yamada said, a frown on his face, "Why wouldn't we come?"
From the way that Midoriya stared at them, he was wondering the opposite.

-

Midoriya was the one who was caught, tied up and thrown into a cage. He was the one that they tried to beat for information, and he was one that reached his hand out.
And yet.
Compress gave Shigaraki a side-eyed glance, watching how their leader bit down on his knuckles until blood spilled. It was a new habit he's never seen the man do. 

Who? He wondered, who was really the imprisoned one here?

-

"Hey," Dabi called out, looking off to the woods. Hawks turned around to stare at him, a frown on his face as he waited for him to speak again.
The seconds dragged into each other, painfully slowly, and right when Hawks was going to abandon this venture totally, Dabi finally spoke up.
"If you actually care about him, then act like it," he spoke, "Or else I might not let him go next time."
Hawks instinctively bared his teeth. Midoriya was his and he wasn't going to let anyone breath on him any longer than he decreed-
But at the same time, he remembered who he was talking to. His eyes took in Dabi's seemingly relaxed posture, the way he talked so languidly, and realized that if Dabi really didn't care, then he wouldn't have said anything at all. He wouldn't have given a warning like this.
"...Really?" he asked, more confused the longer he thought about it.
"Yeah," Dabi said, "At the very least, I wouldn't beat him until all the skin on his back was replaced." He lifted his hand up, calling the fire to his hand, "Though I'd leave my mark in other ways."
Hawks narrowed his eyes, but the man wasn't done. Putting both hands into his pockets, he leaned back as he leveled Hawks with a scortching look.
"At the very least, I'd make sure he only dreams about me. Nightmares and all."
And Hawks wondered what Midoriya would have to experience, for them to replace all of his dreams, the best and the worst. 
"...He came like that," he said, betraying his entire group. Dabi stilled and he turned to him.
"You're telling me that a Human crossed the Abyss?"
"Yep," Hawks said, "Came out of it half-dead, but he won't tell us what happened."
Dabi's eyebrows furrowed.
"Did he run away?"
"Probably."
Dabi's mouth opened, his shock returned with Hawks exasperated grin. 
"What could have been so bad that he ran away through the Abyss?" he asked.
"Can't tell you," Hawks shrugged back, "And he won't either."
He could see the man thinking hard about it.
"Too bad you don't care," Hawks added, feeling a little more sadistic than he probably should.
The other man reeled backwards like he was burned (ha!), and after a second, he turned away and left without another word.
Oops.

-

"You're human," Enji said, "You won't age with the rest of us."
Midoriya blinked. He placed his hand over his heart and then nodded.
"So if I want to turn, should I wait until I'm closer in age to you?"
The pinched expression on the older man's face was indecipherable, but he surged forward. Slanting lips across Midoriya's. Massive hands came to gently grip his chin, which was silly since Midoriya wouldn't turn his head away.
"I am," he said quietly when he pulled away, "doing my best to control myself." 
Midoriya gave a shaky exhale, licking his lips to take in the rest of Enji's taste on his tongue, and shivered at the way Enji's eyes darkened.
"If I... If I say that it's okay not to control yourself-"
Enji's hand covered his mouth. His eyes dropped to the ground as he took a deep breath. 
"Don't, Midoriya," he said. "Do not tempt me like that."
Hands came up to the hand on his mouth. Closing his eyes, Midoriya leaned into the touch, he opened his mouth and ran his tongue across Enji's palm-
The hand was ripped from his mouth with a snarl. Enji's chest heaved as he bared his teeth at Midoriya. Maybe if Midoriya was more demon than human, that might have had some effect, but this was Midoriya, a human who crashlanded into a land of monsters. What would he know about fear?
Midoriya flashed him a sheepish, almost shy kind of smile.
"I trust you," he said, probably having no idea about the weight his words held. "If you wanted to kill me, then you would have done that by now."
"Midoriya, there are fates worse than death."
"So I've been told," the young man agreed, "But you know, I don't think it'll be a fate with you."
Enji looked at him like he had cut his heart out. Midoriya wondered how it could be possible that someone as big as Enji, who fought and fucked with aggression and every breath he took exuded how much power under his skin. It felt like there was an imbalance in the world, to see him look so vulnerable. 
"It's okay," Midoriya said, because the thought that someone cared enough about him and his well-being to hurt themselves trying to keep him safe was something he never got to experience until he met Enji.
So, if this man betrayed him, Midoriya knew he wouldn't be able to blame him. 
"I don't mind getting hurt for you or because of you."
And Enji looked at him like Midoriya shot him instead. 
"What's wrong with you?"
The young man grinned back, like a world with Enji was a beautiful thing, and Enji could no longer imagine being happy world without the color green.
"I'm not sure," he said, "maybe it's a human thing?"
Enji remembered being human like it was a far distant memory. A time period where blood burned on his skin and the only colors in his world was a burning orange and a still gray. 
He slowly kneeled in front of Midoriya, grabbing his hands and pressing a kiss onto the inside of his wrists where scars webbed like shattered glass. He didn't know what kind of life Midoriya lived before this, that it left its mark on him so permamently, but it was fine.
If, instead, Midoriya would stay by his side unti their spirits tire and their body returns to the earth, Enji thought that he would know what peace would be.

-

"...The truth is, I've been lying to you the whole time," Midoriya said, a smile on his face as he stared at his hands. They tembled, and he gave a watery laugh. His heart raced in his heart, because this would kill him.
However, to lie to the people who have taught him what [kindness] was, felt like a fate worse than death.
He wrangled the blanket in his hand.
"I'm not actually a person. Like a human, person."
"...What?"
Midoriya didn't dare lift his head, but Shigaraki's voice was cold.
"I'm not a person! I'm not a human!" he shouted out. His hand gripped the blankets tightly.
"Then, what are you?"
"I'm..." he stopped and got up. Pulling his shirt up, he turned to show that awful mess of scars and burnt remains of a seal that kept pulsing, "I'm a slave."
"...What's a slave?"
Midoriya blinked, "What?"
"What's... a slave?" Hawks repeated. "If you're it, then it can't be that bad."
Midoriya, who knew of how kind Hawks was, knew he didn't mean those words. He knew, but still his eyes watered.
"I... I was born into it," Midoriya explained. "It's a... a tool, for their Master to use."

-

"Okay, then we'll kill him and youll be free?"
Midoriya shook his head.
"If you kill him, I die." And then, he paused, "Though I guess that's a form of freedom too."
A hand came to his head, and he peered where Enji kept his eyes forward.
"Don't think like that," he said. "The only future you should be looking for is one you share with us."
The warmth seeped back into his heart and his whole body.
"...My Master is dying," Midoriya said, "Probably of old age. It's a matter of time for me at this point." He placed his hand over his heart, "I can feel it."
"Don't call him that," Enji added, he moved to sit in front of Midoriya. Cupping Midoriya's face in his hands, he added, "Don't call him that anymore."
Midoriya stared at him, and leaned into his hands. Quietly, he shook his head.
"Midoriya..."
"To call Master by anything else would result in more pain," Midoriya said, "It's... not worth it."
And Enji, who had seen Midoriya get up and try to move after being impaled through the thigh, who had seen Midoriya laugh even after being tossed off a clif, never knew that there was something that could dim his radiance. 
"Midoriya, I-"
A bunch of feathers suddenly covered his mouth, and a foot came to kick him to the side. With a huff, Enji moved, narrowing his eyes as Shigaraki and Hawks climbed onto the cot next to Midoriya.
Sandwhiching the young man between them, uncaring of the way his face flushed and he squawked as they squished them between them, they stared down at Enji.
"Now, now, no need to keep the fun to yourself," Hawks said with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.
"Tch, this place is too damn crowded," Shigaraki scowled, pushing at Enji with his foot some more.
the older man stood up, "I'll go hunt you something."
"W-Wait, I-I'm," Midoriya's eyes darted from how Hawks' hand rested on his thigh and the way Shigaraki was already pushing his nose against his curls.
"Unless you're going to feed me heat, I'll go and cool down."
Somehow, Midoriya's face turned a darker shade of red, and Enji smiled back.
"Take your time," Hawks called out.
"Go die out there," Shigaraki added.
"You guys!" Midoriya gasped.
Enji rolled his eyes and left the room, waving over his shoulder.
"Be safe!" Midoriya called affter him, and since he couldn't see Enji's face, wouldn't know how his words could dye his cheeks in pink.
"Midoriya," Hawks purred, "You're not in any place to be worrying about someone else, are you?" 
"Uh."
"So smart," Shigaraki murmured against his ear, grinning when Midoriya shivered against him, "and so dumb."

-

"...The guy who hurt you," Aizawa said, careful not to call him Midoriya's Master even though it was correct. "Who was he?"
"...He's a wealthy landowner. He really liked my mom," Midoriya said, "and so I was born."
Aizawa's eyerbrows twitched, but Mioriya didn't think that it was that special for his poker face to break. It was a common story that could be found everywhere but here, after all. 
Well, he supposed that might be why.
"...He's your dad?"
Midoriya nodded.
"His name is Midoriya."
Aizawa froze, looking to be like a statue, and Midoriya turned away.
"...So everytime we called you Midoriya..."
The young man grinned back, "It made me feel like a person."
Aizawa's hand grabbed his, and even though he didn't say anything, he was trembling.

-

"Doesn't it bother you?"
Midoriya tilted his head, "Bother me...?"
Dabi pointed at the huff at Midoriya's ankle.
The young man followed his gaze down and then quickly hid it behind his other leg.
"Sorry, it's pretty gross, huh?"
Dabi stared at him, "Don't smile like that," he said, "Don't sile when you don't want to."
Midoriya blinked at him, and then gave a small laugh. "When I'm with you, it just comes out," he said. "I don't wanna frown when I'm with you."
"...You're witty," Dabi said, grabbing his hand and interlocking their fingers together, "I'll give you that."
Midoriya gave him a toothy grin. 


### betrayal?

Midoriya tilted his head, confused and pleased, and Dabi tilted his head with him. Was something missing? Was there something wrong?
"No, it's nothing," Midoriya said, staring at Dabi like he was beautiful, "I... It's nothing, don't worry about it."

-

"...That would have been the perfect opportunity to betray me," he explained.


### solo lvl

>> dabi moves out & into apartment 
>> natsuo moves in
>> midoriya stays at their place unitl he moves in
(( his place gets caught in a dungeon-break? he comes and deals with it))


Dabi's eyebrows creased, "Looks like it's still too big for you," he said. And while looking over his notes, creased his eyebrows and frowned. "You, have you lost weight?"
Midoriya tilted his head, "I... don't think so?"
A large hand reached to grab his wrist and pulled him closer. With an increasing frown and furrowed brows, summer blue eyes landed on his face, "You definately feel like it."
"Really? I can't tell."
"You been skipping meals again?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
"Uhm..."
Dabi's other hand came to his hip, and slowly moved up his chest. He gave a little hum, and tilted his head up to meet his eyes.
"You eat anything yet?" he asked, "Let's eat together today."
Midoriya took another step closer, his cheeks starting to dust as he gave a quiet giggle. "You know, we eat togther everyday."
Dabi rested their foreheads together, closing his eyes as he gave a quiet hum, "Hm... Is that why everything tastes so good these days? Makes me exited for our next meal."
Behind them, the salesclerk held a strained smile on his face.

-

"You're not," Midoriya said, certain.
"I'm not...?" Touya's voice trailed.
"Ugly," Midoriya said, "You're not."
Dabi stared at him and then looked down. "Midoriya, you can say that because my old man's different with you-"
Standing in front of him, Midoriya craned his head up and Dabi's looked to the side so they wouldn't meet gazes.
"You think I'd lie?"
"I think you don't know enough people to make a fair assessment."
Midoriya grinned, big and bright.
"Then, as I meet new people and I don't change my mind, would you believe me again?"
And Midoriya, who had to be reminded to heal himself, held his ground.
"Dabi?"
The older man leaned down to kiss him, but the young man took a step back to dodge it.
"Nuh-uh," he replied. "Because I don't wanna kiss someone who beats down on the person that I need to keep me alive."
"I hate that about you," Touya murmured. "Can't you just accept it?"
"No, because you accepted me."
Midoriya's hands came up to Touya's face, a warm smile on his face.
"You shouldn't have chased after me that day, if you didn't want to take responsibility for your actions."
Touya's hands came to hold Midoriya's against his face. Closing his eyes, he nuzzled his face into the palm of the calloused hands that spared no effort to save his life.
"You're right," he said, heaving a deep breath, "The man tht caught your eye must be drop-dead gorgeous."
"What modesty," Midoriya giggled back, "I should reward you for that."
"Ooh," Touya purred, leaning in a little more, "What were you thinking?"
"I don't know, pizza?"
Touya's face fell. "Something... sexier?"
The young man tilted his head, a frown forming on his face, "...You don't want pizza?"
"Nope, I love pizza," Touya said, willing to do and say just about anything to make sure thatsmile returned. He was rewarded handsomely, as Midoriya beamed back at him.
"Me too," he said, his voice just coasting on shy.
And Touya gave this rich laugh, like he had the whole world in his hands.

-

Midoriya stared at the remains of the apartment.
"...Oh," Midoriya said quietly, "I'm homeless."
Kamui's head whipped towards the young man. No one died today, courtesy of the Best Supporter in all of Japan, but at the same time.
This rickety old apartment? The Best Supporter in all of Japan was staying here? Obviously not anymore, but surely he would have better housing than this. Standing next to Midoriya, he couldn't help but notice how small the young man looked. While he looked puny next to Endeavor, Nishiya had stood next to Endeavor before too. The man had a way to make people just feel small.
But next to him, in the flesh, Midoriya was tiny. He barely came up to his chest, kind of tiny. Like, Nishiya knew that kids were small but it was different seeing it like this. Compared to the amount of mana that came out of him just a few moments ago, it made him look smaller.
And yet this was a child who had been through more A-Ranks than him. 
"...The lease wasn't over," Midoriya said quietly. He turned to Nishiya, confused and a little frightened. "Do you think that means I have to pay for the cancellation fee?"
Without thinking, Nishiya blurted out his true thoughts.
"You can board with me until you find a place to stay, and we can help you make sure all the legalities are taken care of."
"There's no need for that."
Kamui jolted, as the Todoroki's appeared.
He heard that Midoriya spent a lot of time with Todorokis, but it didn't click in his head until he saw the eldest son walk forward. Immediately draping his arm around Midoriya, cold blue eyes narrowed at Nishiya.
"Thanks for the offer but we'll take it from here."
"Dabi!" Midoriya shined, previous grivances already forgotten. 
Touya's ice blue eyes seemed to thaw for just a second, as a large hand toussled green hair with an easy smile.
"You good?" he asked.
"Yeah, I... I didn't finish paying off my lease so I don't know what's going to happen with that contract," he said. "I don't think I have enough to pay for it, but I guess if I don't have to pay rent anywhere, I could get the money together..."
"Just stay with me until you figure that out," Touya said, rubbing his hair. "It'll make gate-raiding easier."
"R-Really?"
"Yeah, so don't think too hard about it."
As he said that, another Todoroki appeared, the Tanker. Kamui had heard that Midoriya was close to the Todorokis. He wondered if they were raiding someplace together before they came to stop of the dungeon break here. 
"It looks everything is in order. The Commission said they will take it from here. I went ahead and wrote our names down as well," Natsuo said. 
"W-Where should I put the extra mana crystals?" Midoriya said.
"They're yours," Touya said, "So, what do you want?"
Kamui thought about how that conversation would go. It wasn't like someone could just tell an S-Class like Midoriya what to do when most A-Rankers ignored direction.
"Do you think they could take the mana crystals to make sure that no one's lease contracts will damage them?"
"You sure? You could make a nice buck and buy a better jewel with it."
Midoriya stared at the crystal, and remembering that absolute horror Nishiya felt facing off that cyclops and the massive gem it dropped, Nishiya felt like the answer should have been easy.
"Okay," Midoriya nodded, "I can pass it over to them. Where's the Commisison?"
"You sure?" Natsuo asked.
The young man nodded, his hair bouncing with him, "We're all homeless now."
The gems that Nishiya gathered from taking out the B-Ranked horned imps felt heavier in his hand. Without looking back at him, the three left to go find a Commission member.
"Whoa!" Takeyama bounced up to him, "Senpai, we made bank today! You want steak for dinner? Maybe some Korean barbeque?!"
"I..." Nishiya thought about it. Back when he was an emerging hunter, his senpais used to take the mana stones he earned, because that's what a party did. When he opened his own guild and created his own party, he swore to himself that he would never do that kind of thing to his own partymembers.
Because that was the kind of person that he wanted to be.
"I'll take a rain check," he said, watching the civilains who were crying over the loss of life and propery and livlihood. "Takeyama, good work today. I'll see you in the office tomorrow."
"Yeah, I..." the blond stared for a moment longer, tilting her head to the side. Placing her shield on the ground, she leaned against it, "Senpai, what are you planning?" she asked. 
"...I think there's something that I can still do here," Nishiya said. He knew and understood that this was a selfish type of kindness, where he was only helping people because he saw someone else do it right in front of him. Come next week, he would have forgotten all about this.

"I repaid my debt to you," Stain said.
Midoriya blinked back, "Whta debt?"
"So now, I feel comfortable saying it," he conitnued, like he didn't even hear Midoriya, "I want to declare my intentions for you," he said. "I know there's probably proper procedures to this, but I don't want to wait any longer. Please consider me as potential to be your mate."
Midoriya's eyes widened, because the thought that Stain even cared about these sort of things never occured to him. Even now, Stain spoke with purpose and without emotions. He bowed at the waist.
"Excuse me."
And left like they had just finished talking about supplies instead. 
"What... just happened?" Midoriya whispered.

-

"Izuku, good morning."
Stain's words remained heavy in Midoriya's mind, 

-

"There's a monster here," Midoriya said, "Probably a big one."
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" one of the other men shouted out, "No! I don't know what your deal is, but there are no monsters here! This is a safe zone!"
"And even if there was a monster here," one of alphas purred as he gave Midoriya a one-over, "Well, I'll take good care of you, omega dear. You don't need to worry about it."
Kido gave that man a hard nudge, his disapproing gaze staring at the man, but the alpha kept his eyes on Midoriya's figure. With a kid, Kido turned back, "While I don't approve of the way he said that, it does stand."
He looked between Endeavor, the hero that he admired the most, and then back to Midoriya. How could someone who traveled with Endeavor be so misled? Kido and the others, who managed to hole themselves into the train station, were probably luckier than the people who were fighting up above. 
"At the very least, you will be safe here. We have rotational guard, food, water, running electricity, the works," Kido said, "Take a break for today and tomorrow. There's plenty of work to be done, so I'm sure there will be something for everyone."
The alpha took another step closer to Midoriya, but Midoriya didn't back away. Maybe being with Endeavor for too long had given him a false sense of secuirty. While Kido believed that Endeavor had an insane amount of control over himself and his instinctual side, he couldn't garuntee that for everyone here.
Because really, an omega going around shirtless like that was going to do more harm than good. It would be different if circumstances were different, but at this time and place, the less that they had to deal with and worry about the better.
So.
"I'm sorry to say, but do you have anything you can wear to cover up?"
Midoriya stared at him for a moment longer, before he turned around.
"W-Where are you going?"
"Kido, I'm glad you're alright," Endeavor said.
"I..." Kido looked momentarily caught off-guard, eyes darting from the omega walking away and then back to Endeavor. "Yes, I'm glad you are well too," he said, and he meant it, but it probably didn't look that way since there was a defenseless omega walking away, "but you don't actually mean to let him go alone, do you?"
"We have a base further away," Enji said, "We came out here to see how it was here. Now that we know, we'll head be heading back."
"A base?"
Behind Kido, he could hear it. 
"Endeavor-san?"
"There's another base?"
"A base with Endeavor-san?"
And the same way Kido longed to follow someone else's lead and stop being as respoinsible for all these lives, he was certain the people behind him agreed. 
After all, Endeavor looked fresh. With a bit of dirt smudged and a little sweaty, but he looked good. Clean-shaven and well-rested, he looked almost as though society never ended. 
Kido had a good idea on what kind of base he must have come from. No wonder the omega didn't want to stay, wait.
"Then, is he... yours?" Kido asked, because Endeavor didn't strike him as the type to not mark what was his.
"Kido," Endeavor interuppted him, "Stay well."
And he turned around. Understanding that the man was leaving, the people that spent their time talking about their glossy future with Kido came surging to their feet.
"Wait, wait, Endeavor-san!"
"Is there, do you have any room with your base?"
While he undertood why they might have done this, it didn't make it any easier. If Kido could, he would abandon everyone here to go follow after Endeavor. Because if anyone wouldn't lose sight of reality and the future, it would be Endeavor.
"That's not up to me," Endeavor explained. 
"Let's stay in touch," Kido said. "At the very least."
The older man nodded, and an almost smile, the kind that Endeavor would have never given on patrol or ever, graced his features.
"Sounds good."

-

"Izuku," Endeavor called out, jogging to join the young man. "Kido explained to me that there are no monsters where they are. The stations are clean, in that sense. They've gone as far as four train stations from where they are, and make it a rotational habit to check them out."
Green eyes stared at him, wide in their surprise and Endeavor nodded.
"I don't think they realize that there is a monster there. From the looks of it, it looks like Kido was with a large number of civilians. I don't think he has the firepower to take on that monster either."
"Why are you here?" Midoriya blurted back. 
Endeavor stared at him, shocked.
"Ah," the young man covered his mouth, "I said that aloud. I meant... no, wait, your wife and children are back at the school. Forget I said that."
"I came back to you because that's what I wanted," he said, "It was not a sense of duty or responsibility, and it's not temporary either," he said. "I came back because it was my selfish desire."
A long silence stretched between them, and the former hero tried hard not to think about how young Midoriya looked when he was shocked speechless. He didn't even understand why Midoriya was so surprised. Did he really think that he was just waiting for a better opporunity? did he really think that there were better opportunities somewhere else?
"I... I see," Midoriya said, looking away first. He turned around quickly, "I..." he trailed off, and then he shook his head like he was shaking the thought out of his head. 

-

"There's a monster here," Endeavor explained. "I let it get away and we chased it here."
"Oh, well that's alright, Endeavor-san. Mistakes happened to the best of us, after all. I mean, you're here to get it, right?"
"Yes. We will kill it."
"...We?"
Even though, with Endeavor were four other well-established and known alphas, all eyes fell right to the omega. The same omega that they dismissed the warning of before. 
"It'll be dangerous. Leave it to the strong and wait for them to come back. You'll only get in the way." 

-

"M-my name is Kurosaki Nanako, actually," she said, raising her hand.
"...Kurosaki?" Midoriya suddenly spoke up, and the room fell silent, "Do you know Kurosaki Misako and Teuchi?"
She flinched backwards, and cautiously she nodded. "Y-yes, they're my aunt and uncle." And the light shimmered in her eyes as she leaned in forward, "D-did you meet them? Are they okay?"
Midoriya stared at her for a moment, "I killed them."
There was a long silence.
"I... you what?"
Her eyes fell to the knife on his belt.
"I killed them with my hands," he clarified for her. "We have their IDs-"
"W-Why did you kill them?"
Midoriya stared at her, the heaving chest, the way her eyes watered, and stared at her.
"Because I wanted to."
"Izuku!" Aizawa's voice was sharp, not quite laced with a command, but definatly inching towards incredulatory.
The young man didn't even look at him.
"If I could turn back time, I would do it again too," he continued, ignoring the way the man had turned to stop him. "And I will keep doing it until someone kills me instead."
He turned around.
"Make your choice, if you're going to come with us."
"Izuku!"

-

Aizawa stormed after him, "Izuku, what the hell are you thinking?!"
When the young man showed no signs of stopping, Aizawa reached out to grab his wrist. The grip was hard and firm, but it wasn't painful. Still, Midoriya jerked his arm to the side, snapping the grip off with the promise of pain.
"What was the point in that?! There are better ways to speak to other people! You don't just start fights when you're delivering the news of their death!"
And Midoriya sighed, like this was a lecture he heard a thousand times and he was just waiting for it to end so he can get back to doing what he wanted to hear. Aizawa couldn't believe it, and the rage bubbled back in his chest.
It was disappointing. The person that could bring such a shy smile out of Jiro and a bright laugh out of Shoji was the same person in front of him right now. Right when he felt like they were making progress, that they were all healing just a little bit, he did things like this that made Aizawa feel sick to the bone.
"Say something!" he yelled out.
And it was like they were back to the time where Midoriya wore that damn helmet, where the world was saturated with uncertainties and high tensions. 
Midoriya heaved a great sigh, like this was such a pain in the ass.
"...If you had to live with the person that murdered your family, wouldn't you want to know before you join up with them?" he asked.
"So this was how you said it? That you murdered them with your hands? Was that even nessesary?"
Midoriya's eyebrows furrowed, "Who would paint a murderer in a good light?" he asked."It doesn't matter what they did or tried to do, at the end of the day, the person that ended their life was me."
Aizawa froze. 
"Is this how you're trying to take responisibilty for this?" he asked. "Do you really think this is the right thing to do?"
"I've never cared about doing the right thing," Midoriya replied back, voice hard and eyes sharp. "I..." he stopped himself, and closing his eyes, he heaved another sigh. Running his hand through his hair, "Are you done?"
Aizawa stared, in equal parts shock and disappointment, "Done? You think this is something you can just finish and be done with? That girl, can you even imagine how she felt?"
And nodding along, Aizawa watched how quickly Midoriya disengaged from his words. He bobbd his head up and down, as his eyes trailed this way and that. 
Aizawa's words stopped cold.
"Are you even listening?"
And Midoriya just nodded some more. 
Grinding his teeth down, a moment of silence passed before Midoriya blinked.
"Oh, since you're done," and he turned to leave. Leaving Aizawa behind with a knot in his stomach that felt like it would grow arms to strangle him.

-

It wasn't adding up. No matter how much Aizawa thought about it, this way and that, it wasn't adding up. 
Aizawa had seen it. In moments where he came too late to be back-up, and saw the bloodbath that Midoriya made of his enemies. The way he destroyed their heads and crushed their bodies. The way that, after hitting some, he would drop his bat to grab them and slowly let them down on the ground.
The way he stood over each body for a moment, silent before he painstakingly tried to find a method of identification for each and every single body that he found and killed.
He thought about that. That image of Midoriya standing over their flower garden, hands caked in blood and still.
It wasn't adding up.

-

"Izuku's not like that," Aizawa heard Uraraka say to their new person. "He prefers making himself the bad guy because he thinks that it makes it easier for him."
"You saying it's not a bad guy even though he's killed my aunt and uncle."
"I'm saying that he didn't kill them because he knew who they were. It's not about being a good or bad person, but at the very least, he didn't lie about it."
"What... What am I supposed to do?" she asked, placing her hands over her heart, "What do I do with these fucking feelings?"
Uraraka kneeled next to her. "That's something you have to decide on your own," she said, "but if you stay here, you should know that you won't have to feel it by yourself."
Her eyes welled in tears, anger and frustration coming in equal amounts with her grief and helplessness.
"What would you know?" she asked, scathing.
"You really think that Midoriya only killed your family?"
Aizawa, whose parents lived in the countryside far away from the city, felt his heart hollow out. 
"I..."
"And if he was that cold murderer you want to paint in your heart, understand that you're alive, eating, resting with the people you came with because of him."
"Then what, I should just ... forgive and forget?"
"No, I'm telling you to look at the whole picture. Because I care more about Izuku than I do you. If you're going to try for revenge, it's not just him you're making into an enemy."
And Aizawa hated the thought that these kids were growing up too damn fast. Leaning against the wall, he wondered if, by trying to shelter and preserve their innocence, he (and all the others) were actually hindering them after all.

-

"Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"
Midoriya hesitated at the hallway.
"Ashamed? For what? Surviving?"
"Don't play dumb. I meant that omega," they said it like they were curisng in church. Looking left and then right, they dropped their voice and returned to hissing the same things that Midoriya's heard so often he could recite them back. "Where's your pride? How could youdiscard all of that to just-just listen to that omega-"
But unlike all the other times Midoriya heard this exact rant, there was a sudden whoosh and the man gave a whimper. Curious, Midoriya poked his head out and indeed, Hawks had his foot on the man's chest.
"You know, I'm really getting tired of hearing that," the blond said. "When I see someone doing a better job, I'll think about changing my loyalties then. I'm not ashamed to do what I need to do to live. I'm not ashamed to follow Izuku. But I'm ashamed that after all this time, after seeing what he could do, there are still people that that refuse to give him credit wherecredits due. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? There are literal children here, workng to make life better, working for the future, and you're still stuck on this?"
"W-wait, Hawks, please, le-let's not get hasty. Let's talk this through-"
"We did," Hawks said. He took a step back with an amiable grin on his face, "You get it, now?"

"Snipe," Midoriya's voice suddenly called over the commlink, "Where are you?"
"15th Floor of the Hakuren Corp, sir."
"...Look out towards the west," Midoriya said, "and tell me if that mountain is moving closer."
"I..."
This was one of those moments that Midoriya hoped and prayed that he was being a silly little omega. He was making a big deal out of nothing. God, please, let him be wrong.
"...It's moving."
Midoriya placed his head in his hands. He never wanted to be more wrong in his whole life. The silence on the commlink rang loudly. 
"...Midoriya," Snipe spoke quietly, "Do we engage?"
Midoriya kicked down the door to the rooftop. He stepped out and made his way to the ledge. Indeed, the thing that he thought was a mountain was getting noticably closer than it did before. At the pacing it was at, it they probably had a month or so before it entered the residental area. 
Meaning, whatever it was, it needed to die before it got too close to their residental. It needed to die after it passed majority of their water sources and the area where the deer congregated. Given that, it was easy to tell when they needed to be ready to take it down, kill it there and do something about the body. He stared out.
"Not today," Midoriya replied, "Finish up patrol and we'll head back."

-

An uncertain silence fell over the base. It's been a while since things were so tense, or rather, maybe it was telling about how relaxed they had gotten over the last few years. 
At the very least, he supposed that it was good that Snipe saw it too, since they were taking him seriously. It also meant that they could get to work as soon as they were here.
"Kill it with fire," Dabi said, "Duh."
"Shoot it," Snipe said, "We got the firepower for it."
"Dismember it bit by bit until there's nothing left," Stain replied.
"Beat it till it stops moving," Miruko explained, cracking her knuckles for emphasis.
"Before we get too excited," Overhaul said, lifting his hand up to stop the conversation, "We're certain to kill it, right? Kill it and reduce it to nothing more than ash?"
"Haah? Of course we are," Shigaraki snapped back, "What kind of question is that?"
"...Because we don't know if it's alive," Midoriya replied back.
Realization dawned on several of the as they stared in shock.
"What the fuck? Of course it's..." Shigaraki's words trailed off. 
"It would be a mode of transportation," Midoriya informed them. "It could be a type of drone. We don't know."
Looking at the map, the young man tapped the approximate area that they figured it was.
"We will continue as we have," he said. "Meeting dismissed." 
"Wait, what? That's it?" Snipe asked. "No change of guard rotation? No preparations? Nothing?"
Midoriya was already turning to leave, wondering if he would find the upper limit of OFA after all.
"If you're calling our dismissal because you're going to go fight by yourself..." Dabi's tone was warning, but cut off when Midoriya opened the door and left. He hefted a great sigh. "...I don't know why I even bothered."

-

"Izuku-shounen," Yagi called out as he climbed the stairs. He swore that he just saw the young omega-
And standing at the windows in front of the stairs, he found Midoriya staring out at the mountain.
"...If that's a monster," Midoriya said, "that can get up and fight, we lose no matter what."
Yagi felt his jaw tighten.
Taking a deep breath, Midoriya turned to the older man.
"Is there something you wanted to say?"
"...I was hoping to talk to you about it," Yagi said, motioninig to the monster, "I wanted to know how you think we should take it down. If we need to."
Green eyes looked at him and then back to the horizon.
"I didn't say anything at the meeting because I don't have any ideas," he said, lied, because if Yagi knew anything about Midoriya, he always had ideas. 
"Shounen, you don't think that I'll believe you when you say that you don't have any ideas? You?" the blond asked, an easy grin on his face and suppressing the urge to fist pump when a smile ghosted on Midoriya's face. "Well, old men like me like to ramble," he said, "Perhaps I could interest you in rambling with me?"
"You're not that old," Midoriya said in a way that would sink deeply into Yagi's heart. Green eyes looked out to the horizon. "I was hoping that we could be able to get some information," he admitted, "but I don't think that this is a fight we should extend."
"What... kind of information were you hoping for?"
"If it's really a monster, if it's made by a monster, if someone made it for a monster, things like that. Where did it come from? Are there more?" And after a second, Midoriya's voice dropped by a pitch, "and if someone was really working with them, who? Why?"
"...Shounen..."
"I'm not afraid to kill. I'm well prepared to do whatever it takes to protect what's important to me, whatever it takes." His hands balled into fists, "but I don't want to make easy decisions that everyone else will live with."
"And you?"
"I think I've done enough bad things to do a couple more," Midoriya said, and he turned to flash a boyish grin at him, looking at once, too young to bear the brunt of all of this, "and I know how to handle the consequences of my action."
