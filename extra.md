### limited collection -> isekai so I guess Reforge 

Midoriya shrugged, "I have two," he said, lifting up two fingers on one hand, "Classes. [Summoner (S-Rank)] and [Blacksmith (S-Rank)]."

-

"Doesn't he know that he can change our weight and size?" Hawks asked.
"I can what?"
"Aw Hawks, you party-pooper."
The blond raised his hands up in mock-surrender. The young man spun to Yamada, voice edging on hysteric, asked again. "I can do what?"
"Any B-Rank Blacksmith could do it," Dabi spoke up from where he was laying in the grass with his arms bent behind his head. "If you had earned your classes instead of recieving them as a blessing, you would have known that too."
"I lost!" Midoriya shouted back, beyond frustrated, "all my memories! I don't know what I don't know!"

-

"Wait, you lost all your memories?" Dabi asked, truly confused.
"Yeah," Midoriya nodded. "Just... woke up in a field one day."
"But you don't remember anything. You don't have a childhood or remember your favorite foods, or the things you hated the most, nothing."
"Yeah. Nothing."
Dabi stared at him and shook his head, "Then what are you fighting so hard to protect?"
Midoriya blinked at him before he actually started to laugh. It was a bright sound, but given the context of their conversation, Dabi felt his temper rise
"What's so funny?" he asked, voice cold.
Midoriya gave him a wide, toothy grin. Running up to him, he wrapped his arms around the older man's waist, rubbing his face in his chest when he wasn't pushed off this time. 
"This is why I fight," he said, resting his forehead against his sternum. "Because this is the world where we got to meet."
He released the man, looking up a little shyly. 
"And I'll keep fighting, because there's something I want to protect."

"Sorry for being so late," Natsuo and Touya came running up.
Midoriya, with a large bandage across his chin, shook his head.
"It's okay, I just got here," he explained. 

-

"So, what are you going to do with it?" Natsuo asked, motioning to the gem in Midoriya's hand.
"Oh, I'm a Supporter," Midoriya replied.
Natsuo, caught off guard by the sudden introduction, nodded his head numbly instead. 
"Yes? I know?"
And now Midoriya was looking at him like he was the one asking the funny questions.
"He's a Supporter," Touya repeated, 0% helpful. And then, eyebrows creasing, tilted his head, "Ah, well, Natsuo-kun's been out of the scene for a bit." He stared at Natsuo, "You know how any magic-class can use gems to channel their magic better?" he asked.
"Oh, like magic tools?" Natsuo asked, patting his shield, "Even I have a few."
Midoriya, eyes on the shield, looked unimpressed.
Touya chuckled, "Well you see, Midoriya here is the best Supporter," he said. Wrapping his arm around Midoriya, who was already starting to blush, he pointed at Natsuo, "and knows how to enhance."
Natsuo blinked. "Enhance?"
"Yeah," Midoriya nodded, "that's how support magic works."
Natsuo, jaw loosening, suddenly remembered the gemstone Touya carried like a touchstone. "Oh," he pointed at his brother, "Oh! You sleep well!"
"See?" Touya told Midoriya, all but burying his head in his hair, "Told you Natsuo's a smart guy. He just needed a reminder."
"Wow," Midoriya said, breathless and almost silently.
"No, no," Natsuo shook his head, "I'm the one that should say that. There's not a lot of people that can enhance anything! And you can just..." 
Midoriya nodded. "Regular buff spells are enhancers too," he said kindly, "So it's not that-"
"Niichan never lets that gem go," he said, "I didn't even realize that he wasn't sleeping well until I can see it. It's been like, weeks now. Your magic, your enhance, lasted weeks outside of a Gate. That's.... If that isn't awesome, I don't think I can handle what is."
And these days, when Midoriya spoke like that, a bubbling kind of rage started to build up in Natsuo's heart. The kind that only burned relentlessly under his skin, waiting for the right target to lash at.
"It's amazing," he spoke certainly. "Anyone else who says otherwise is horseshit."
Touya snorted, but pulled away from Midoriya. "What do you think about Natsuo's shield, by the way?"
"It's... uhm," Midoriya looked at the shield, then at Natsuo, hesitated, and looked back down.
"It's fine. I know it's not great," Natsuo said, "It's just a temporary until I can get a better one."
"That won't be hard," the young man said, his eyes tracing the shield, "To find a better one, I mean. It'll be really easy. I think most rocks can do better than this."
Natsuo felt his eyebrows rise. And, licking his lips, bit the bullet.
"Do you mind?" he asked, "nothing big and fancy since I'll be replacing it soon, but a small one? I just... I really like watching you cast magic."
If Midoriya got any redder, they would need a healer for him.
"O-Oh," he said, "I uh... I can do that for you."
And Natsuo pretended that he couldn't see Touya stick his chest out with a wide, toothy grin. There were more important things for him to focus on now anyways. 
Midoriya placed his hand on the shield.
"Some basic defensive runes should be good. And maybe an anti-erosion spell." The magic swirled around Midoriya's arm, before condensing right at his fingertips. The soft glow rested against his shield, shining it and polishing it brighter than what it was before. 
"Uh, Midoriya, this isn't a little spell," Natsuo said, breathless as he watched.
"when I was... thinking that you would be protecting us," Midoriya gave a little shrug, "I couldn't help it."
His heart raced in his chest, for reasons different than awe. 
"Oh," he said.
"Yeah," Touya said, wrapping his arm around his shoulder, "Oh."
Blue eyes were sharp, for just a second, like Natsuo did something he wasn't supposed to. Like back when they were kids and Natsuo followed Touya even when he was told to go away. 
He stared back. If Touya wanted to protect this, then he should work a little harder. Nothing worthwhile in life ever came easy, and all that.

-

"A C-rank?" Midoriya's eyes were wide and bright. There was nothing about his expression that denoting any bits of nervousness.
"Yeah, we managed to get dibs on it," Touya said, "You wanna go?"
The green-haired man shot up in his seat, "Yes!"
It was, obviously, unheard of for a C-rank Gate to be cleared with a party of three, A-Ranks or not. The fact that they were given this permit meant that someone really wanted them to die. He didn't think it would be their dad, since Natsuo didn't think that Enji would even notice if they were dead or alive. Maybe if they got too big, because it would make it harder for Shouto to shine.
As always, just thinking about the youngest-father pair made a frown twist on his face.
"Ah... Natsuo-san, you don't want to?"
Natsuo jolted out of his thoughts, and guilt started to worm into his heart when he saw the way Midoriya deflated.
"No, sorry, I lost track of my thoughts," he said, shaking his head. "C-rank, right? Let's go for it."
Touya gave him this look, which was surprising because Natsuo thought it would have been straight contempt for being a wet blanket. He didn't really know how to explain it, and Touya squeezed his shoulder.
"The people that notice when you're gone are right in front of you," he said. He turned back to Midoriya, a smile already stretching on his face, "Let's head out the day after tomorrow. Do you need to prepare anything in advance?"
The young man shook his head, curls bouncing with how hard he shook his head.
Touya gave an exaggerated sigh and shrug. 
"Nat-chan and I need to get new gloves. I need shoulder supports and he needs stuff for his legs. You wanna come with us?"
"A-Are you sure?"
"Yeah," Natsuo said, because there were only two people in the world that would notice when he died. "It'd mean a lot to me if you could give your opinon on enchantments and stuff. You're really good at that stuff."
Midoriya's cheeks turned a little pink. His eyes fell to the ground as he smiled shyly.
"Then, I'd love to come along. Thank you for inviting me."
Touya reached out to ruffle Natsuo's hair wildly before he left without another word.
Natsuo scowled, but he didn't mind. 
There were only two people that he would notice if they died, too.

-

<<<<<<< HEAD
"Uhm, Natsuo-san?"
Natsuo looked up at Midoriya, did he really have to wait for him to put food in his mouth to call out to him? He gave a garbled response, lamost choking on his food, and ultimately waved his hand at him.
"Go ahea'," he said, covering his mouth as he spoke. "Wha' up?"
Touya grimaced at him. Whic wasn't fair. Touya was in a Gate for five years and he ate neater than most civilized people who didn't spend any time in any Gate. 
"Is... your arm alright?"
Natsuo swallowed everything in his mouth as fast as he can. He took a drink as he frowned. Eyebrows furrowing, he said, "Yes? Is something wrong?"
"Your left side is always lower than your right," he said. "I noticed it last time we went hunting. I think it's a balancing issue."
"Oh serious?" Natsuo asked, "Well, I guess the person that would notice is the person who's always behind me. Any tips on how I can fix it?"
Midoriya chewed on his lips. "Fixing it yourself would be best, but I can give you a temp fix while we're in dungeons."
"That sounds great!" Natsuo replied a grin on his face. "To be honest, ever since I saw that Niichan had an enhanced gem, I wanted one too, but I never knew how to ask."
The pink that colored Midoriya's cheeks was easier to see under the floursecent lights than in the dark dungeon.
"Then, if you don't mind," Midoriya lifted his hand towards Natsuo, "Your hand, please."
"It doesn't matter which one?"
Midoriya nodded, "Since it'll just be a balancing-charm. So you have an idea on what it'll be like."
A charm? Natsuo's heard of charms, like the type that people get from temples to wish for good fortune and stuff during New Years. What would a charm from Midoriya, who had a black-eye when Natsuo never got anything worse than a papercut, look like? He stuck his hand out, carefully ignoring the piercing look his brother was giving him, and Midoriya's small fingers came to his hand.
"Wow, you're so big," he said, probably innocently as he ran his fingers across his hand. As his face began to heat up from the sudden and geniune comment, an inexorbiant amount of mana suddenly surged. It was like seeing lightning crash down. Just as fast. His pace raced, as though he had narrowly missed death, and all the hair on his neck stood up straight. 
Several chairs screeched and scraped, and the magic in the area intensified. Around them, regular civilians stopped chatering and eating to gaze at the standing people, wondering what was going on. 
In that instant, Natsuo understood exactly who were hunters and who were civilians.
Midoriya pulled his hands back. "I enscribed a basic balancing buff," he said. "It should last for the next week or so. By the time we finish up with the shopping, we should have a gem. I'll do something better then."
Natsuo stared at his hand. Numb. His hands trembled as he tried to take control over his body.
"...Is everything alright? Did it hurt? I made sure to-"
"What were the spells, the enchants... your process," Touya asked, eyes hard, "Explain them to me rigt now."
Midoriya blinked, and a little confused explained, "Before inscribing any extra buffs, I should make sure that his body is clear of any other buffs and debuffs. So, a [Cleanse] and [Replenish] would help with that. Then, I apply the enchant-type buff [Balance]. I figured that we didn't want to wait too long, so I casted [Rapid Casting] on myself," he explained. "Cast time, 2 seconds. Application time, less than 1 second."
And Midoriya wasn't even a B-Rank. A shiver ran down Natsuo's spine again.
"Midoriya," Natsuo said, "I think you should consider the reassesment."
Because Natsuo might have been away from the field as an active hunter, but that didn't mean he was ignorant. For anyone to cast anything, that fast with that much mana was someone that could easily stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other A-Ranks.

"We're a party of three," Touya said. "As in, there are three of us."
Midoriya nodded. "You, me, and Natsuo."
Touya let out a short sigh of relief, at the very least, he didn't have to explain this part. Next to him, Natsuo gave him a dirty look. 
"What do you think about adding another person to our party?" Touya asked. 
"Like another frontliner?" Midoriya asked. "I think it'll be nice to have another person at the front. It'll help with your charge time and take the strain off of Natuso and my gems."
Natsuo, who had to have an hour long explanation on why their gate-clear time was so long, dropped his gaze in shame. He didn't even think about adding another member to their group. Of course, part of it was because he was comfortable and happy with just the three of them. Adding another person felt like it would ruin their hard-obtained balance.
Midoriya tilted his head, "did you have someone in mind?"
"Nope," Touya replied. "I didn't know if you liked big parties or not. If you didn't want anyone, then there would be no point in inviting anyone in."
Which, by the way, was not even close to the threats that he threw at Natsuo when Natsuo refused. No one would know or care, but Natsuo did. 
"But would anyone even want to party with us?" Midoriya asked.
"Oh yeah," Touya said, "They will."
"Like who?"
"Like anyone who has bills to pay, mouths to feed, or are looking to climb up the ranks."
"Yeah, we're pretty popular," Natsuo said.
"We are?"
"Yeah, we were trending yesterday."
"We were? But we weren't swimming."
There was a brief pause. The brothes exchanged a quick glance before 
"Midoriya, where's your phone?" Touya asked.
"Oh, it's right here! I found it, so I made sure to bring it today!"
Was this the moment? Natsuo couldn't help but wonder. Were they finally going to exchange numbers? Almost three months since they started jumping Gates, they were finally going to exchange numbers?
Midoriya pulled out a phone. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that he pulled out half a phone. The numpad part of a flip phone sat innocently on the table when Midoriya pulled it out of his pocket.
Natsuo had seen Midoriya perform straight miracles in dungeons. He had been under his magic, a kind of magic that inspired confidence and protection. He's seen Midoriya repair lost arms and half-eaten Hunters back to their original health with nothing more than a wave of his hand. 
And that Midoriya, who smiled at the ground when someone complimented him, beamed at his party members as he showed his sad excuse of a phone.
"Ta-da," he said, bursting at the seams. 
Natsuo looked at it. Something nice. There had to be something kind about this that he could spin. There has to be a way to say something nice-
"Does it even work?" Touya asked, "To be honest, I haven't had a chance to get a phone for myself."
That's right, Natsuo remembered getting Touya's old brick-of-a-phone to him when he woke up. The doctors mentioned that it would be good for him to have something familiar, but now that he was using his head, he was beginning to think that it did the opposite of help. 
"Let's get new phones," Touya said, "Matching ones, but different colors."
"Aren't phones expensive?" Midoriya asked, like he doesn't go through gemstones like popcorn.
"Hm, should we go to another Gate this week?"
At the prospect of another Gate, he straightened. Eyes shining like stars, he nodded eagerly. 
Touya's expression melted just a little bit, and Natsuo wondered if this was what he was going for. 

-

<<<<<<< HEAD
"I can't get re-assessed," Midoriya said.
"You can't?" Touya furrowed his brows, "Damn, it's really expensive."
Midoriya pursed his lips, and they all stopped. It wasn't about the money, wasn't it?
"...It's not that..."
The two stared in a pensive silence.
"...They said that you can't be reassessed until I'm 20."
"Until you're..." Natsuo trailed off.
"...twenty?"
The two stared at Midoriya for a moment longer.
The young man tilted his head, "I can go in six years. So I guess I'll be clearing E-Ranks until then."
Natsuo's jaw dropped. Touya took a deep breath in and placed his head in his hands.
"Oh."
Midoriya nodded solemnly.
"Oh my god you're fourteen?" Natsuo whispered. And, doing the mental math, hissed out, "Oh my god you pulled Niichan out of a gate when you were fourteen?"
Midoriya shook his head, "That was before my birthday."
"You're birthday passed and you never told me?"
No, Natsuo bemoaned, please Touya, focus on the things that matter, please.
Holy shit, he could get arrested for this shit. He wasn't sure what place could imprison an A-Rank hunter like hismelf, but still. The thought was there now. It was doing shit to him.
"It... didn't seem that important."
Touya worked his jaw. Did he even know when Natsuo's birthday was? He never brought it up. 

-

"...What?"
"I'm going to move in with Midoriya," Touya said, a bag slung over his shoulder. "See you at the gate on Monday-"
"Wait, wait, wait, what do you meant youre... You're just leaving?"
"Yeah. I just said that."
His bag was slung over his shoulder as he stared at his brother blankly. He took a deep breath and rubbed the back of his neck.
"Natsuo," he said, unchracteristically somber, "I'm going to be a hunter. Until Midoriya is of-age to take the reassessment, we're going to stick together and resume-build. After that, I'll probably apply to one of the bigger guilds." 
Natsuo didn't know what he wanted to be when he grew up. Even as a kid, it was something that no one really asked him because everyone figured that he would follow in his father's giant footsteps. 
"But Natsuo, you went to school because there was something you wanted to know, right?" Touya said, "You probably didn't tell me because you wanted to keep it to yourself. It's okay. I'm okay now. You can go back to your own life."
He reached out, and placing his hand on Natsuo's shoulder, slowly brought him into a hug. It was an action that no Todoroki has ever down in this estate, probably. 
"Thank you. I'm glad that I have a brother like you."
With a toothy grin, with a spring in his step, with eyes brighter than anything Natsuo had ever seen growing up, Touya left the Todoroki Estate. 
=======
"...You live where?"
"In the apartments..." Midoriya trailed off and pointed, "Over there."

>>>>>>> 4bc2b68e80c9f7ebb9033d3151376424e4aa031a

-

"Natsuo, what about your dreams? You don't have to be a hunter! You can be whatever you want! You don't have to give up on your studies!"
"...Did your students say something?" Natsuo asked.
"What? why?" Fuyumi asked, her eyebrows furrowing in her confusion.
"I couldn't think of any other reason why you would suddenly care," her brother replied. He took in her hurt expression, and sighed. He just didn't have the energy to deal with this anymore. All they did was fight. And unlike being in a gate, it wasn't the good kind of fight.
Grabbing his bag, he shrugged.
"Fuyumi, you know, I've always hated dad. I always hated dad, and when I grew up, I realized that I hated mom too. I hated them, but avoiding them was easy." He shrugged, and met her eyes. "But you know, I don't want to hate them. It's exhausting. So it's better to be strangers. It's not like you even knew what I was studying for."
And with the last of his stuff, he left the Todoroki Estate. This time, he hoped forever. 

-

<<<<<<< HEAD
"They're recruiting for the S-Rank raid that broke open," Natsuo said, "All Hunters, inactive or active, and required to be on standby. At the very least, registered parties are allowed to stay together."
And by that, Natsuo meant that he was glad that they would be together and not with the rest of their family like they normally would be. Little blessings. 
Touya shrugged, "If it looks bad, we'll skip," he said.
"I'm going to the Gate," Midoriya suddenly confessed.
Touya froze. His spoon slid out of his hand.
"What?"
"They scheduled me for a reassessment," he said, "So that I will be the S-Rank Supporter that will join the Assault Team on the Boss Room."
"They... can't make you do that," Natsuo said. 
Midoriya nodded, "I volunteered."
Natsuo was floored. "Why?" he asked, unable to wrap his mind around the news he was given.
Instead of answering, Midoriya repeated himself.
"I'm going to the Gate. Because that's where Hunters go."
Deep inside, Natsuo always thought that he was born wrong. That the universe made a mistake for making him awaken. That he grew up wrong because he grew up in a household so skewed compared to ordinary people but so successful that no one noticed. Feeling as though the grond was taken from under his feet, Natsuo felt like he was swaying. The familiar feeling of enroaching doom, like he was going to go home, crept up his throat. 
"...Nothing we say is going to change your mind, is it?" Touya said, finally speaking up.
Midoriya shook his head.
"...Come back safely," he said, a thousand time more mature than him. "Should we suspend Gate-Jumping until after the raid?"
Midoriya nodded and Natsuo felt sick. This was why Midoriya agreed to meet up on a date without any planned Raids or equipment checks. He did it to say goodbye.
If, when Touya went into that Gate all those years ago, they said goodbye, woud Natsuo have moved on smoother? Hed didn't think so.
If he lost Midoriya, if Touya lost Midoriya...
Natsuo didn't think they would luck out like they did with Touya. 
"Yeah," Midoriya asked, nodding his head. "I'm sorry I won't be able to come with you."
"Don't worry about it," Touya said, waving his hand. "Just worry about coming back, alive and intact."
The young man nodded, and Natsuo focused on keeping his mouth shut. Obviously, Midoriya didn't want to go. Obviously, Touya was even more torn up about this than he was. Obviously, there was no place for him here to be worried or even care-
"I will," Midoriya said. "So let's raid together afterwards."
And Natsuo, the stupid idiot he was, opened his mouth and blurted out, "Midoriya, I don't want to lose you. I love you. When you come back, please look at me like a man."
He didn't get to see what kind of expression Touya shot him, because all he could see was how red Midoriya was turning.
"Huh?"

-

"Natchan," Touya said, "You're a fucking idiot."
Natsuo covered his face.
"I know."
"No," Touya said, staring blankly ahead, "You really don't. You're a fucking idiot."
Natsuo tried not to cry.
"He should be focused on the Gate."
"He should focus on coming home."
Touya gave this sigh, turning around and Natsuo wondered if this was the difference between an attacker and a defender. 
Which was stupid, because by that logic, that meant that their positions should have been flipped.
But he supposed that for Touya, who only killed monsters after they were weakened, this actually made more sense.

-

"I don't really get what it means," Midoriya said, "and I don't want to hurt him because I don't know what to do." 
"Do you want to know?" Touya asked.
Midoriya shrugged, his back hunched as he curled into himself a little more. The tiny bits of confidence that Touya thought he had seemed to dissipate like it never existed.
"I've never... thought about it. Things like that. It's always been about when I'll eat next and what Gate I can go to."
"You can let Natsuo take the wheel, and just let him know when you're uncomfortable."
Like they do in Gates.
"It's not a gate," Midoriya said quietly. "You're not there."
"If I was there, would it be better?"
Hesitantly, Midoriya nodded and Touya felt something loosen in his heart, "But that's not... what Natsuo wants, right?"
Touya stared at Midoriya for a moment longer. The world would be a better place if there were more people like Midoriya than him. He tapped his chopsticks to his bowl as he thought about what he wanted to do.
"Think about it," he said, "being with me and Natsuo."
"Isn't it wrong?"
"Midoriya, do you remember when you got me?"
The young man's head snapped up, a brief moment of frustration crossing through his eyes, but taking in Touya's expression, he released a breath instead.
"...Of course I do."
Touya's lips twitched, like he was about to smile but stopped himself. 
"For the most part, anything and everything inside of a Gate is an enemy and we're supposed to treat them as such. Even if they aren't hostile, there are a lot of things that we can do with every bit of gates that we bring down. Coupled with most Supporters' ability to carry and bring things like that home, "kill now; think later' is usually the default reaction most hunters have in Gates." 
Things that they don't kill could come back and kill them later, after all. No need to make anymore risks than nessesary.
"Get to it."
it was rare for Midoriya to sound so impatient. 
"But you didn't kill me. Didn't even try."
Midoriya blinked at him. And maybe he didn't remember as well as Touya did. And maybe Touya remembered better because it just meant more to him than it did Midoriya. It was fine, if that was the case. 
"I..."
"And because you didn't, we're here now," Touya continued. "What you did was wrong, in that moment. Months later, now that we can see how it worked out for us now, we can say that it was okay. That it was the right thing to do." He shrugged back, "But from then to now, what were you thinking?"
Because Touya had followed Midoriya into gates, he knew. Midoriya didn't shy from killing. It was just as much of an ingrained response in him as it was for any full-fledged hunter. Watching the S-Rank raid on TV only went on to prove him correct.
"Were you really thinking about what the right thing to do then-"
"That and this are different!" Midoriya snapped back, slamming his hands on the table. It creaked and cracked under his fist, and Touya's eyebrows hiked up his forehead. And just as fast, he felt something in his heart settled.
It would figure that the thing that could make Midoriya lose his infinite patience would be him and Natsuo. When he thought about it like that, that greedy part of him surged forward.
"Then what's really the issue?" he asked, keeping his voice just as low. 
Around them, the silent restaraunt slowly resumed their ambience. A sweating manager motioned for a waitress to go towards them, but Touya waved them away before they could get closer and give Midoriya a way out.
"I..."
Touya placed the money down on the table.
"Take your time to think about it. I waited five years in that Gate... No, I waited, probably my whole life, to meet someone like you," he said, getting up. "I'll wait however more."
Midoriya came out as the only S-Rank Supporter in the world. Before long, he would know and understand that there are better options for him, in every way possible. But there was something about Midoriya that no one in the whole world knew, and that was his bullheaded loyalty. 
Even if this was wrong, even if this was bad, Touya wanted to be happy before he wanted Midoriya to be happy. He wanted to fight for something himself. He wanted to fight, not because he wanted to live, not because he wanted to survive, but because he wanted to be loved as much as he loved.
And that meant that he at least tried.
"Friday at four," he said. "Natsuo and I will be at our usual. If you want me, us, show up."
And he left before he was reduced to a sobbing, begging wreck. He didn't want Midoriya's pity, after all.
He wanted something else.

-

Midoriya came, four pm on Friday at the train station. 
He looked at them, his hands clenched into fists until his knuckles turned white, and licked his lips. 
"I'm not here to do the right thing," Midoriya said, "Or the wrong thing."
He took a deep breath before he looked at the brothers who offered more than their hearts.
"I'm here because I want to be happy too." He gave a polite bow, "Please take care of me-"
without waiting for him to finish, Natsuo had collected both Midoriya and his brother into his arms. Spinning around, flexing his A-Rank Strength to anyone with eyes, he gave a loud laugh.
"Jesus, Natsuo-"
"Oh my-"
Their words were drowned out from how brightly Natsuo laughed.

-

"Miodriya, do you want to move in with us?" Touya spoke up. 
Natsuo choked on his tea. They haven't even gone on their second date (Gates don't count).
"Oh, really?" Midoriya said, "Is that okay?"
Touya nodded, "Then we can just go straight to the Gate."
His face turned pink, a shy little smile on his face as he stared at the ground, "I... I haven't lived with someone in a long time."
And instead of doing the right thing, Natsuo opened his mouth and said, "It'll be a sleepover party every night."
Touya gave him this look. He kept his eyes forward. He was getting really good at this.
"I..." the previous expression of shy excitement dyed into shame, "I've never had sleepovers before."
Natsuo had an idea on what kind of life Midoriya lived, before he awakened as an underage supporter, and it made something inside of him burn.
"Well, plenty of time to learn," Touya said. "We can pick a day and time to help you pack and move."
Midoriya nodded back, his excitement returning in such a small way. It reminded Natsuo of the flowers that bloom facing the ground.

-

"If you want him gone, he's gone," Touya said.
The difference in raw strength between an S-Rank and an A-Rank was the difference between an adult and a child. 
The difference between an S-Rank and a civilian couldn't even be compared to a person and an ant. 
If Midoriya wanted them gone, they would be gone, and the whole world would be powerless to do anything. Obviously, if all the S-Rankers ganged up on him, their might be some damagers, but who in the right mind would go after the only S-Rank Supporter in the world? It was as dumb as it was foolish. The rest of the world would sooner send their hunters to Midoriya's aid. 
International affairs didn't mean anything when it comes to the possibility of creating good relations with an S-Ranker like Midoriya. 
And well, Touya wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty. In fact, Touya would be more than happy to drench his hands in blood, if it meant that Midoriya wouldn't frown.
If that's how he felt, he could only imagine how Natsuo was feeling. 
Midoriya closed his eyes, leaning his head backwards.
"...Let's eat kabobs tonight," he said.
Touya and Natsuo briefly locked gazes before Natsuo pulled up nearby kabob places and Touya leaned back in his seat.
"You sure?"
Midoriya nodded, "Yeah. It doesn't really mean anything to me."
Even though none of them were present, Dabi felt like he could feel all of Japan's collective sigh of relief.

"Dabi, what's that?"
The three stopped in the middle of the street. Ignoring the dirty looks that the other pedestrians gave them as they were forced to change their route. 
"Uh..." Dabi stared at what Midoriya pointed at and then shrugged. "Natsuo, what is that?"
Natsuo, pulling his phone out and googling it, answered with a prompt, "It's a new store. They well lingerage."
Touya straightened, and gave Midoriya a toothy grin, "Sounds like our kind of place."
Midoriya's eyes trailed from Touya's chest to Natsuo's, his face turning into a progressively darker color of red as he shook his head.
"G-gate, we should do to the gate."
Touya's chortling laughter rang loudly, alarming several civilians around them.
"Hey, isn't that..."
"Oops," Touya turned away, "Better get going."
"You're the one that blew our cover," Natsuo hissed back.

"Midoriya, what about Spain?" 
"Spain?"
"Or really any of these European countries," Touya added, "At least we can get married there."
The following day, legislation passed and gay marriage was allowed. Touya, clutching his sides as he shook with laughter, gave Midoriya a sloppy kiss to his cheek.
"You wanna have our honeymoon on a beach? The Caribbeans are beautiful this time of year."
Midoriya playfully pushed back. 
"I don't really care as long as we're together."
The bitter energy, the angry comments, the petty attributes, all faded away in that second. It left nothing except for the gentle smile on Dabi's lips. A little slower and intimate, he kissed Midoriya's temple, then his cheek, and placed his forehead against Midoriya's. Eyes closed, he gave a small hum.
"We can do that."

"I don't... I don't understand," Midoriya said, looking at the pamphlet and then back up. "It said 50% drop. It said..."
"We ran this exactly 100 times," Dabi noted, pinching the bridge of his nose. "And we haven't gotten any drops."
"No," Midoriya said quietly, his voice just barely a whisper. "Just. No." He shook his head. 

### Way Back Home

Well, Midoriya thought to himself. This was new. His hand came to his side, as though to verify with his eyes because he didn't actually believe it. Indeed, it was true. His hands, soaking in his own blood, the bits of flesh that splattered on the ground behind him, the smoking gun in front of him, all of this led him to the same conclusion.
He had actually gotten shot. There was actual blood, his blood, and what was probably some bone and other bits of his flesh.
While he obviously should do and be something other than fascinated, it was probably better than panic. Calm down, he told himself. 
He looked forward to the man who just shot him, and then behind, where Eri was kept safe.
If he panicked, this would become a traumatic memory for Eri. If he panicked, the situation would get worse. Calm down, Midoriya.
Calm down.
He took a deep breath and looked back at the man.
"Drop the gun," he repeated again.
This time, the man did. He was honestly shocked that he could hear him, when Midoriya felt like his ears were ringing.
He gave a smile, "See?" he said, "We can start here."

"I don't... I don't understand," Midoriya said, looking at the pamphlet and then back up. "It said 805 drop. It said..."
"We ran this exactly 100 times," Shigaraki said. "And I guess we'll be running it 100 times more."
"No," Midoriya said quietly, his voice just barely a whisper. "No, I don't want to spend my days like this."

"Why don't you ask Chiyo-san?"
"...Who?"
Todoroki furrowed his eyebrows, "Chiyo-san," he replied. "Midoriya stocks candy for her every once in a while."
The blond blinked back, "He what?"
"You didn't know?" Todoroki frowned back. 
"Okay, okay before we get into our trust-issues and insecurities," Sero spoke up, lifting his hand up, "Where is it? Let's just head over."
"I don't get it," Mineta said, "He has a phone. What's the point of his phone if he's not going to ever use it?"
"Mineta, you're just jealous that no one wants your number."
"Alright then," Bakugo snapped out, "lead us there."

"They said that you were injured!"
"That your arms were broken!"
"That your teeth were punched out!"
"That you lost an eye!"
"That you were shot."
Midoriya, holding a box of choclate bars in his hands, gave his friends an exasperated smile.
"As you can see, I'm fine."

### Rotting Flower

"Don't kill him!"
Snipe jerked in response. The [order] had bound his entire body for a second. With a frustrated sigh, he took a step back. Lifting his gun, he shot him in the thigh to make sure he wouldn't run. He screamed, the sound bouncing around the room, as he curled around the wound.
"Do we really need to keep him alive?" he asked his Master.
Midoriya nodded, "If we kll him, all his slaves die with him."
Snipe paused, and turned back to Midoriya. He gave a quiet chuckle. He wondered how anyone could ever say that Midoriya was a cold person? De-materializing his gun, he took a step back.
"Sensei," Midoriya called out, "Take care of the rest."
Around Midoriya, a black smoke curled around him. The sight of it, and the feel of that malicious energy, had Snipe recoiling. 
"Step back," Midoriya warned him. 

### Pansy

Alone, Shennong thought, he was okay being alone. He thought and believed it, until that hand slid into his, and with a wide grin on her face, tugged him along to view the starry skies from the flower field. He should have been okay, being alone.
Wrapping an arm around her, his human, he rubbed his face alongside her. She giggled, a bright sound that he could encase in his heart so he would be reminded of a time when he wasn't alone.
