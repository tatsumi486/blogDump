Not for the first time, Izuku couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. He stood up and stepped back from the maps he hung around the former second-year classroom. He had hung the maps up a long time ago, but othertime, the others had added other maps as they found them as well. Eyebrows furrowed, he mentally mapped out the way patrols had been running. He thought about it, the things that were mentioned and tried to think of what wasn't. 
Eventually, he couldn't get an answer until he wrote out all the streetnames and then started to crossreference. Within a few hours, he had an answer. Getting up to his feet, he couldn't believe that no one had been checking around the small mall by southside. 
In the time it took to get out of the area and down the street, he already had four people following him. He really did wish that they had better things to do.

Enji had heard that Izuku had gotten badly injured.

>> Rex won't die so long as Pyra's alive?

"He'll live," the healer said. She closed the door behind her, narrowed eyed, and stood in front of the door.
Sensing the change in the atmosphere, Malos frowned back.
"...Can we go in and see him?" Akhos asked. "Not that we don't trust you, but we'd like to check for ourselves."
"...He's my patient. While he's recovering, he's under my care and protection. I won't allow anyone to try and hurt him now."
"...That sounds awful like you're not going to let us in," Akhos narrowed his eyes back.
Just then, several other men came out into the hallway. With various weapons in their hands and disdain painting their faces, it was clear that they were outnumbered here.
"Leave peacefully," she said. "We don't want to fight where the injured rests."
While Jin and Akhos placed their hands on their blades, standing back to back and glaring at their new enemies, Malos remained still, staring at the healer.
"You really want to separate a Blade from their Driver?"
It wouldn't be hard. It would be laughably easy. When it came to an indescripbable amount of strength, they had that in spades. 
"I'm separating abusers from their victims."
"Wait, what?" Akhos blurted back. His eyes flitted from the people in front of him to the woman and then back. "Are you kidding me? Rex said it was a cold. He just needed some medicine and some sleep. Why are you acting like he's dying?"
To their shock, her jaw dropped open. Eyes wide, she snapped back.
"Because he is dying!" she yelled back. "Aren't you his Blades? Shouldn't you know when your Driver is hurt? Shouldn't you care?"
Akhos bristled, but Jin straightened out. His hand dropped from his blade.
"Can we at least see him?" Malos asked.
The healer stared at him for a long moment, and shook her head. "No."
Suddenly, a loud crash echoed from inside the room, followed closely by a loud, "Waaagh!"
Wasting no time, Malos shoved the healer aside and stormed into the room.
"Wait!" the healer rushed in, barely a step behind him.
The scene would have been hysterical at another time. One of the other nurses was tossed onto his back, groaning in pain. The other one was trembling in fear as she stared at Rex. Said man, pale face distorted into a grimace, with a pen in his hand, spun around to the open door with eyes brighter than the evening sun. His eyes were unfocused, and the white bandages on his chest were rapidly coloringg red. "Pyra!" he screamed out. His voice cracked, stricken with grief as his hands came to claw at his chest, "Pyra!"
"She's not here, Rex!" Malos yelled back. He came in front of him, exposing his core crystal to his eyes met Rex's. "We're going to get her, remember?"
Rex's chest heaved, but his eyes landed on Malos and he could see him. 
"...Malos?" he asked, his voice but a quiet whimper
"Yeah," he nodded. "Your Malos."
Rex nodded, "We... we need to go," his voice crackd again, and he took a shaky step forward. "She's waiting."
The healer took a step closer, ready to object.
"We will," he said, slowly closing the distance between them. "Trust me for tonight."
He reached his hand out, and Rex didn't hesitate to take it. He gave a nod.
"We need to get... her."
And promptly passed out.
"...You're right," Malos said, catching Rex and placing him on the 
bed with ease. "I'm a Blade. He's a Driver. But we're not synchronized."
"I... see," she said. "That doesn't excuse the way you treated him. He's not a toy for you to use until he's broken."
Malos, watching how Rex's chest heaved with every breath, didn't respond.

### 1+2

"Y-You're hurt?"
And Malos could feel Rex shutting down more than he saw it on his face. His lips turned from his scowl to a frown as Rex turned around.
"...Shulk, I-"
"Are you... owwie?"
Rex's expression softened as he kneeled down. Opening his arms, Shulk wasted no time running right for him. Small arms clutched around his torso tightly, and squeezed. He trembled as Rex wrapped his arms around him tightly. Placing one hand on Shulk's head, he positioned it to rest on his shoulder.
"Malos is a worrywart," Rex replied back, giving Malos a stern glare as he kept his tone light. "But I'm fine, Shulk. If I wasn't fine, could I do this?" And with a triumphant yell, he picked his little brother up by his armpits. Swinging them around in a circle Shulk's shrieks of joy echoed throughout the room, accompanied by Rex's laugh.
Malos leaned against the counter, a frown on his face as he wondered what it was like to have someone to keep injuries from. 

-

"Did you have to lie about it?" Malos asked, his hand on Rex's back where his stitches were strained. "You couldn't just... not do it?"
"You know," Rex winced when Malos' fingers pressed too hard, and the older man kissed his temple as an apology. "When I was Shulk's age, I didn't have to worry about a single thing. I knew we were poor, but I never needed anything."
He placed his hand on Malos chest, right at his sternum and leaned back. Peering up at the tall man, he gave a lopsided grin.
"I want Shulk to get that too."
Malos frowned.
"I don't want it if you have to sacrifice yourself for it."
"It's not a sacrifice," Rex scoffed back. He stared at Malos for a bit and then gave a crooked grin. "Don't blame him when I'm the one that shouldn't have been so careless."
Malos' hand came to his back, easily encompassing the majority of it, and pulled him closer. 
"Don't be so careless," he murmured against his ear. "The only one that can leave marks on your is me."
"Wow..." Rex drawled the word out, giving Malos a tired look. Resting his head against the Blade's chest, however, he took a deep breath in and relaxed. "Then, I leave myself in your care," and promptly fell asleep.
Malos flinched, catching Rex with ease but mildly alarmed.
"Jeez, what am I going to do with you," he sighed, picking him up with ease. 

-

Rex looked from Reyn to Malos and then back. He gave a wide grin.
"New look?"
Reyn beamed back.
"Looking good," he said, heart warm as he waved off the young child. He stretched his arms over his head, rubbing his neck as he relaxed. 
At that second, Malos came out with a frown on his face.
"Me, right? You mean I look good."
"Don't compete with the four year old," Rex warned.
Frowning, Malos placed the plate of slice apples on the table, took his seat next to him, and his Driver stared at him blankly. 
"You're not pouting are you?"
"Don't you have another good-looking guy to talk to?"
"Malos!"
"Is that what you're into?" 
"I thought he looked good because he's trying to look like you!"
Malos grin was unrepenting, and Rex understood that he walked right into that one.
With a loud groan, he buried his face into his hands in a futile attempt to hide his bright red face.

### Way Back Home 

>> Nightlife: Late Night Detour
When you hit someone, it's expected that they get angry. Maybe scared, but in Shirakumo's experience, it was always anger. A bubbling, indignated fury that comes out with the blood. They might scream and yell, swinging their fist or kick their feet, and they were always, always, always thinking of a way to fight and win.
For this reason, Shirakumo was certain that Midoriya Izuku wasn't human.
"Fight..." his voice barely came out in a whisper. It was so quiet he couldn't tell if it was he was speaking or he was thinking. The words lodged in his throat and he tried to get up. His hands trembled under the weight of trying to sit up-
He watched as someone brought a wooden stick over Midoriya's head, breaking it into pieces. The young man stumbled backwards by two steps but straightened right back up. Blood ran down from his forehead and his breath came out in a ragged mess. Spitting out a mouthful of blood, Midoriya picked his head up like he never got hit in the first place.
"Fight..." Shirakumo whispered. Another brutal hit came for Midoriya's side, a crack echoing out and Shirakumo finally found his voice. "Fight back, Midoriya! What are you doing?!"
Midoriya picked his head up, was this really the kid that Aizawa said took on all of Hina-san's exboyfriends? If anything, he was just a durable punching bag. Blood spewing from his lips, Midoriya straightened like he hadn't been hit at all.
"Please let Shirakumo-san go," he said again, and dipped his head forward into a polite bow. "He's very important to me."
"Is he important enough to die for?"
"He's important enough to live for," Midoriya immediately countered.
The blond stared, wondering where people like Midoriya even came from. He could figure it out, that Midoriya's life was a checkered mess of violence and misfortune. Shirakumo didn't even go through half of the things that he did, but Midoriya didn't even look upset. He wasn't scared. If Shirakumo really had no idea how the human body actually worked, he would have even believed that Midoriya wasn't hurt either.
No malice. No ill intent. Looking at them as calmly as he did when he first came in, Midoriya stood, confident and certain.

"...I think that if something were to happen to you," Midoriya gave a smile, the kind that pepole give when they actually wanted to cry, "The world would be very quiet."
"...Were not friends," Yamada said, his voice breaking. "I'm not Shota, you know. I'm not... I'm not even handsome."
And Yamada, who had only ever known disappointment, felt undeserving of such a gentle gaze.
"We're not friends," Midoriya agreed, "but you're important to me."
Yamada didn't get it. He wasn't smart, was never smart, but even he knew that guys like Midoriya just didn't exist.
Guys like Midoriya, who saw Yamada everyday and knew who this was, and still smiled like that, just weren't real. A part of Yamada had been so empty thatit was aching. It ached in it's emptiness, and no matter what he drank, what he smoked, who he induldged in, it remained empty all this time. Like an open wound left to fester in the summer heat, Yamada always thought that he would never know or even begin to understand why he had been empty this whole time. For as long as he remembered, he's felt like this.
So he thought that Shirakumo and Aizawa were just like him. That's why the fit so well together. All of them were empty with no chance of ever fitting in with the other people who didn't have that. 
His arms came around Midoriya and held him tight. 
It wasn't empty. He wasn't broken.
He just hadn't found Midoriya yet. His hand came to the young man's head and tucked him against his shoulder.
Soaking wet, shivering from the cold, Yamada realized that the hole in his heart was something that could be filled by a kid that barely came up to his chest.
"Midoriya," his voice came out in a broken croak. "You stupid idiot. Care about yourself more, you know how sad Shota would be if something happened to you?"
"He'll be sad if something happened to you too."
And Yamada felt the tears prick in his eyes because that was a new thing. If Aizawa even noticed that he was dead and gone, it would because of the person in his arms right now. He held on a little tighter.
"Y-Yamada-san-?"
How could a single person change the whole world? The thought itself felt naive and innocent, but Yamada didn't want

>> Student Verse: Commuter's Woes
Summary: Midoriya of Aldera Public High School's Class 1-A was a nutjob.

"I..." Tokoyami's voice dropped until it was quiet like a shadow, and he backed away like he was ready to disappeared, "I'm... scared."
Midoriya, the nutjob of Class 1-A at Aldera Public High School, stared back at him before he gave a small smile. He extended his hand out.
"It's okay, Tokoyami. I'm scared too."
"No, you're not," of all things, Tokoyami would never think that Midoriya would lie to him. "You're never scared."
"...I'm glad you think so," he said. "When I was little, my favorite hero told me that when I'm scared and hopeless, angry and lost, that's when I should smile the hardest." He gave a grin as he pushed his hand towards Tokoyami. "And if I'm with you, I don't think there's anything to be afraid of."
"...You're a nutjob," he said. He looked the hand extended in front of him, and looked back up. 
Green eyes stared at him, gentle in their gaze. Faced with an exression he hadn't seen anyone ever give him, Tokoyami's hand reached for him too.

>> Expired Lease

That whimpering seemed to echo. It scratched at his ears and tugged him out of his sleep. Lips twisted into a scowl, eyebrows furrowed, he glared at the ceiling. If he wanted to listen to someone cry and moan, he'd have stayed at his home.
But his annoyance and his foul mood vaporized when he remembered where he was, who he was with, and he whipped his head over to Midoriya. Staring in wide-eyed shock, he watched the white-knuckled grip he had on his blanket. In his sleep-fogged brain, Dabi tried to connect the fact the sounds were coming from Midoriya.
As the realization sunk, he suddenly felt alert and awake. The kid who made the rain stop was suddenly someone that was laughably weak. This was the person that carried him up. It took another moment, but he realized that the young man was actually trying to say something-
"...sorry..."
Great, the kid was apologizing in his dream. Somehow, more than the fact that he was so rudely awakened, the fact that the kid was apologizing to someone made a familiar rage stir inside of him. 
He sighed.
"...I'm so sorry..."
He didn't want to hear someone else's pity party. 
"Oi, oi, wake up."
He jolted at Shigaraki's voice. This was unexpected.
"C'mon, Izuku."


-

"Stop that," Dabi said, grabbing Midoriya's dishes. "I'm sick of hearing you apologize."

-

["this isn't your world"]
Midoriya woke up, tears streaming from his eyes. He sat up, fingers coming up to his eyes and he took a deep breath.
Today too, he was in the wrong place.
