>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

Dabi felt a weight suddenly lean against him and he froze. His eyes darted to the side, and indeed, Deku's head was against his arm. 
His eyes stared at the young man, frozen stiff where he was.
"Deku," he said quietly. He didn't want to wake the young man, he always looked so exhausted, but he also didn't want the man to sleep on him like this.
In front of him, Mina walked in with a folded map, no doubt finished with her quick patrol, when she caught the two of them. She looked at Deku, then Dabi, then back, and then gave a ferocious grin.
She gave Dabi a wide grin, a big thumbs up, turned around and left.
That bitch. Asshole. Fucking help him.
And unable to move even an inch in any direction, he sat stiffly. Cursing long and hard in his head, he couldn't believe those hero-wannabe assholes.
They should have at least left their jacket so Deku had a blanket. With a forlorn sigh, he looked again at Deku, sleeping with his chin to his chest, and wished the young man could sleep more comfortably. 
He's never met Deku when he was cranky from lack of sleep. A part of him didn't want to see it, but the rest of him wouldn't mind seeing. 
Well, whatever. 
He leaned back slowly, careful not to jostle the young man. He was sensitive to everything. 
Tired, he closed his eyes, figuring that nothing would happen to him as long as Deku was next to him. Just for a moment, he thought. He was tired.

"Where's-"
"Sh!"
Enji, while he was privately glad that the others were a little more comfortable with him, felt mildly annoyed at the fact that he had just been shushed. 
But Mina smiled up at him, bright-eyed and she motioned him closer with a hushed, "Look at them!"
Enji peered over, and saw the way Dabi's head leaned on top of Deku's. The way Deku slept against Dabi's arm, mouth slightly open. Their hands rested against each other, palm to palm, Deku's arm crossing over Dabi's, and otherwise looking comfortable.
Staring at them, Enji felt a surge of pride.
Peace, he thought. All their hard work and effort had accumulated to a single moment. Everything they had done, for these 15 minutes. Eventually, it would be more. It would be much more.
"Let them rest," he said. As long as he they needed to.
Enji would protect it. What he couldn't protect before, what he didn't realize what was important before, he would be certain to protect it now.

Deku jumped up to grab the top of the railing, a manuever that he's done before, and swung his legs up. As he did so, the railing creaked and snapped. 
Oh shit, he thought. 
Four floors up, the ground looked mighty far from where he was. Right when he thought that, there was a rush of wind and he was watching the railing clatter to the ground.
"Can't take my eyes off of you for a second," Hawks said, arms tight around Deku, under his arms and around his waist, hoisting the man so that they were eye-level. "Well, it's not near 

# kind nightmare

"Shigaraki Tomura," Kurogiri said, and for a guy who was all smoke, he was extrodinarily good at expression his displeasure just by saying Shigaraki's name, "Why is your clothing so tight?"
And Shigaraki, whose pants were clinging and up to his shins, button broken and ripped open, hoodie a tight crop top that he ripped the back and shoulder of getting it over his chest. Aside from the catcalls he got and some gasps, Shigaraki felt like he was breaking all the wrong laws.
"Fuck off," he said, walking through.
"There is a sudden increase of Pro-Heroes in the area, exercise better caution-"
Shigaraki walked right by him, slamming the door behind him and Kurogiri sighed. Sensei didn't seem particularly interested if Shigaraki could use his quirk or not, explaining that he could have everything and more soon enough, and Kurogiri didn't care if Sensei didn't.
He stared at his impeccably clean bar, not a speck of dust, since Shigaraki returned with missing fingers. Sensei it was good that he was gaining independence, but according to the day-drama that Kurogiri watched, he knew that a girl must be involved. Was this little friend aware of who he was? What he was trying to do?
Was she the reason why his recent behavioral patterns had changed?
Kurogiri needed a little more information, then he would be certain. Surely, Giran would have a good recommendation for a reliable investigator to garner some more information.

>> hires chimera & co? in exchange, Kurogiri covers the cost for Nine's sugery/experiment thing?

"Augh, this is such a waste of time," he sighed.

Two days later...

"Kid's got like, ten people coming in and out of his house-"
"Yeah, but four of them are like his teachers-"
"And you wouldn't believe-"
Chimera cut them off, "Which ones?" he asked, remembering the feeling of Midoriya's scarred fingers running through his fur. 
He paused, and when he didn't get a response, glared at the other two.
"Well?"
"...I thought you did stakeouts too," Scissor said. "Shouldn't you know?"
"It's not like you're one of them, right?"
There was a pause when Chimera didn't answer.
"Chimera," Scissor gasped, scandalized but there was a bright gleam in her eyes and a smile starting to stretch her lips. "Should we be expecting a new addition to the team?"
"Uh," their current youngest hesitated, "He's a literal kid. On his way to being a hero. No?"
"You don't want to be called "senpai"?"
And Chimera couldn't wait for Nine to wake up and then whip all of them in gear, because he honest to god was considered it.
"Well, I guess it wouldn't be so bad."

"...I don't know," Midoriya said, "how to take responsibility for my actions. I-I know that I have to face consequences, but I don't... I don't think it'll be enough."
Dabi laughed, a bitter sound that would hurt much more than his fire could.
"What a pretty way of saying that you don't want to do anything. You don't know how to, so you don't bother, but you sound like you're putting your best foot forward, right?" He tilted his head, the wide grin on his face was unnerving as always, but these days, Midoriya din't think that was all. "All you have to do is say you're trying, and that's it! You don't actually have to do anything. I should have been a hero. Then, I really would have gotten away with everything. Who cares about actually working?"
Midoriya placed his head on the table. 
"You're right," he said. "It's just talk, isn't it?"
He gave a hollow laugh.
"Thank you, Dabi," he said, a smile on his face, "I think I get it now, what I have to do."
Because Midoriya wanted to be a hero. He wanted to save people with a smile on his face. He wanted to make All Might proud, graduate with a smile on his face with all his friends, and climb the hero-ranking. He wanted to protect someone.
What Midoriya wanted was easy to prioritize.
He looked over at the older man, and gave a lopsided grin.
And Dabi, instead of a mocking grin or a snide comment, frowned as he stared at him.

"...I feel like we haven't eaten lunch together in a while," Iida explained. "I... I hope everything is okay. And regardless if it is or not, I," he hesitated, and the normally impeccable Iida looked like a teenager, lost and stumbling just like Midoriya did.
"We just want you to know we are here for you!" Uraraka called out, her hands clenched into fists and a grin on her face.
Midoriya felt his back straighten, his eyes shining and he grinned right back.
"Thank you," he said, breathless. His eyes watered and he scrubbed at his eyes as discreetly as possible. "Thank you, truly."
Uraraka's gaze turned a little more concerned, as she stepped forward to place a hand on his shoulder.
"It's okay, Midoriya," she said.
"We know that you will, well, you have, done the same for us before," Iida said, his smile broad as he stepped closer. "A burden is easier to carry if you split it."
Midoriya laughed, a watery sound, but he felt like it was like coming home. Not exactly so, but very close.

-

"But you have a teacher!" Monoma shouted, "You have a teacher and even All Might favors you!" His hand came to his hair, tugging at it and he screamed out. "Don't take Kan-sensei from us!"
And Midoriya had forgotten that it went both ways. The time he took from a villain, ensuring that only one person would be hurt, was the same as taking the time from a hero, and ensuring that no one would be otherwise saved. 
Midoriya stared at him for a long moment, but couldn't find his voice. Even if he could, he had nothing to say.
"Hey!" Hound Dog rounded the corner, "The bell has rung! Get to class!"
Monoma stared at Midoriya for a moment longer, a dark glare before he stalked off, and Midoriya stared at the empty space for a little bit longer.
"Honestly," Hound Dog sighed, "I can't believe this. And you all want to be heroes?"
The words dug deeply into Midoriya's heart, but it didn't hurt as much as it normally did. Midoriya made his way back to his classroom. Aizawa took one look at him and clicked his tongue.
"Detention, Midoriya," he said, "Don't be late again."
"Yes sir."

-

Nezu was sharp. Aizawa was aware of that. He looked over Midoriya's performance evaluation. He needed to remain impartial. It wouldn't do Midoriya any good if he cut him any slack. He needed to be treated the same 

# returning a gift

Hejike frowned as he looked at the notebooks, "Is it even worth it?" he asked.
"Hejike-aniki," Midoriya said, voice quiet and gentle like a kindergarden teacher instead of a yakuza, "I am wanted and unneeded. If I am killed, brutally and cruelly, no one would even notice. I have no quirk or allies."
He clutched the notebook, soggy and the ink probably had probably all ran together and was worthless now, to his chest. Immediately, his shirt soaked, and Midoriya turned his bitter smile up to him.
"This is the only way I can survive."
And Hejike couldn't believe that he and Rappa actually had something in common.

# scenario

"There's no way we can break it-"
"We can!" Midoriya shouted back. "Magic isn't perfect! It doesn't outweigh physics!"
"W-what the hell do you-"
"When you fire arrows, the weight brings it down. From hellflame heat travels up, try as everyone has, this magic-this quirk-whatever they are, they still abide by the laws of our gravity and our physics!" Midoriya yelled back. "There is no such thing as an infinite source of energy! At some point, there has to be-be a level that it can't keep going! There has to be a maximum value to this!"
Shigaraki stared at him, wide-eyed and Midoriya yelled out.
"Us too!" he said, reaching his hand out, "This isn't our max potential. And since there is no previous example, then it'll be us! First a case-study, then a coincidence! Third time will be a habit, and by then, the world will see it!"
Midoriya yelled out, his voice seeming to echo across the field. And as it turned out, hope was a small person who could thaw winter.
"The winners will be us!"
Yelling that loudly, there was no way that the enemy couldn't find them. The giant orc seemed to come from nowhere, something larger than a truck as it came in front of them.
There was a flash of fire, and it was engulfed in an instance. Standing in front of him, Ingenium's arms were tight around Midoriya's body.
"Alright," he said, "What... what did you have in mind?"
