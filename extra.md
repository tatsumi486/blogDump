"Good morning!"
Deku jerked like he heard a gunshot. His head snapped over to where Present Mic stood down the hallway from where he was. Deku stared, and then looked left and then right. Who could he be talking to? It couldn't be...
"I'm talking to you," the blond replied back, coming up to stand next to him. "Morning!"
Deku stared at him. Luckily, his helmet was snug on his face, or else the whole world would be able to see the dumb expression on his face. He stared back, wide eyed and slacked jaw, wondering 

-

On occassion, things like this happen.
Deku stared at the man, what was left of him. The shapel ran right through his gut, a sharp and jagged thing that was three inches from taking out his spinal cord and giving him a merciful death. Just from looking at him, the way his breathing was deep and labored, the way his legs were an infected cesspool filled with squirming maggots and oozing pus, and understood that this man would not live for long, and the time he had spent alive must have been excruciating. 
His eyes dropped to his arm. Two holes in his upper arm, and it dyed his entire sleeve black with his blood. Undoubtedly, this man was infected.
"A-Ayakase?" the man wheezed out. The name on his lips sounded like a prayer, and Deku wondered who he was looking for that his eyes looked so focus instead. "A-Aya-Ayakase-I-I knew it-"
And his pale lips, chapped and faded, stretched into a grin that split his lips in parts. 
"I knew you'd-you'd come back-"
Deku kneeled down next to him, and took his hand in his. The man's hands could not curl properly, and one remained limp by his side. He held the larger hand in his, and understood when he came closer that his foggy gaze ensured that he couldn't see Deku.
"Augh, that the fuck is that smell-?"
Deku stood up, because undoubtedly, the others would be here soon, but the man's hands twitched.
"W-Wait!" the man wheezed, "D-Don't go-Don't go."
Deku, who could not save this man, wished he could give him mercy instead. However, he would not deprive this man of any form of comfort he could give. He relaxed back where he could sit next to him. 
"I-I can't-" the man coughed, a wet sound as he tried to push these last words out, "I-I can't go with you. N-Not worth it. D-Don't worry."
What courage. Deku wasn't sure if he could do the same. No, that was a lie. He knew that he wouldn't do the same. He would whine and cry, sob and scream, and otherwise curse those that left and those that came. He wasn't made of courage, and would be easily swallowed by his fears. 
"I-I lived a long time," he said, voice raspy. "S-so don't w-waste your time..."
"Helmet?!" Hawks voice rang out, "Where are you?!"
"A-are those you-your new friends, A-Ayakase?"
Deku wondered what the right answer was. He squeezed the man's hand a little harder.
"Haha... Ha," the man chuckled, and Deku wondered what this man would sound lie if he was at full health. When he was with his Ayakase, how brightly would he have shined, and how loudly would his voice echo? The thought that this laugh would be extinguished soon made his heart twist into knots. "Good. Good. D-Do'nt be alone, Ayakase. That's-That's not living. Ju-Just surviving. A-Ayakase-"
"There you are! Damn, we should put a bell on you or something-"
Shigaraki's voice rang as he came closer. It drowned out the last thing the older man said, and Deku felt cold.
"Get away from him!"
Shigaraki's hand grabbed Deku's shoulde rand yanked him back. Pulling a knife out, he went to swing at the man when Deku kicked the back of his knee.
Shigaraki dropped to the ground, a curse on his lips, and Deku scrambled to kick the knife away from him.
"I-It's alright-" the man with the shadow of a laugh said. "It-it's alright. Ayakase... You'll be alright."
With two last heaving breaths, the man clsed his eyes. Understanding what needed to be done, because there was no way that this man wouldn't turn, Deku grabbed his bat and brought it down to his head.
He would die a human. It was all Deku could do. 
"W...What the fuck? What the hell is the point if you're going to kill him anyways?!" Shigarkai snapped back. The man got up to his feet and gnashed his teeth. "You think I can't do it? You think that I can't kill a couple of shitheads?"
And his scowl stretched even bigger.
"I've been here longer than those shitty heroes!" he snapped, "And they're just wating to stab you in the back! They're not nearly as glamorous as they are on screen! It's just a ploy! You can't trust them!"
He took a step forward, and slapped his chest.
"I can do it! I can do anything and definately better than some full-of-shit Hero! I have nothing to return to and nothing to fight for! I just have you!"
Deku, head reeling from the sheer amount of information overload that Shigaraki dropped on him, wihed there was something to say or something that he could do.
"You saved me for a reason, didn't you? They-they just followed you here but you saved me-you saw me and you made that choice to save me! So I mean more to you, don't I?"
Save?
Deku?
How could Shigaraki ever think that Deku saved him? If he could just lose his temper like this, yelling and screaming until his voice gave out and his hands trembled, was he saved?
If Deku was even a fraction of a real hero, would Shigaraki actually been saved? Because he was so half-assed about this, did he condemn Shigaraki to an even worse fate?

"It's worth it," Ban Yeoryung cried. She wiped at her eyes and rubbed them hard, even red-rimmed, they were breathtaking. Fat tears ran down her face and the words came out strangled, and still, she was beautiful. "It doesn't hurt. I can do it."
"...Yeoryung?" Dan-i whispered back. As the main lead, she supposed it wouldn't be this easy.
"I'll protect it. The world where-where we eat ice cream together. The world where we s-sleep next to each other. I'll do it," she said. "I'll protect the world that I share with my Dan-i."
Dan-i, on occasion, wondered what had happened in their past, that this beautiful woman was so loyal to her. The original Ham Dan-i must have been someone equally beautiful to have earned that loyalty. 
"Yeo-ryung," she said, collecting her hands, and smiled. "Having you here is enough for me." She leaned in, pushing her long hair behind her ear, and grinned. "Every day I get to spend with you is my most precious treasure."
