### forever spring

Summary 1: On the side of Death Mountain, there lived a pocket of land where a young farmer lived, carefully avoiding his harem of very, very powerful people.

Summary 2: After a lonely life in a hospital bed, Midoriya Izuku is isekai'd to another world and told to "live selfishly" and given three wishes. 

[wishes: good health, green thumb, and a way to help other (medically)]

- for purely selfish reasons, all the women are futanaris. 
- people heal faster, grow stronger the more they like Midoriya
- post-apoc modern-fantasy (but Midoriya is so removed from society that he has no idea that he's actually in a world just like the one he used to live in), and everyone agrees to keep this pocket of the world safe and tucked away from the rest of the world and all the awful things from there

Aizawa placed his hand over the eyepatch and pulled it off.

"Well," he said, staring out 

-

"Ah," Midoriya said, and nodded his head, "Yeah, I uh... figured."

Aizawa looked like someone had plunged a knife into his chest and twisted it until his heart came out in pieces. 

Looking at the ground, the young man's hands nervously wrung each other. 

"I mean... Those kinds of wounds don't come out of nowhere," he said quietly, "and more than that, you uh... you looked like you were having a hard time. Just, uh, seeing the world and hearing birds chirp and stuff like that." He rubbed his shoulder, and Aizawa felt that pang of guilt, as he always did, when he thought that he had hurt Midoriya.

"...Why didn't you say anything?" he asked quietly.

Midoriya 


### immortal izuku x tsukauchi

"...Nothing happened," Midoriya said, and tiling his head like that, Tsukauchi would have believed him like the rest of the officers in the room did. "Or... did something happen?"

Frurstrating, but it really looked like it. Midoriya Izuku, just walking by in the street and happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and lucked out by totally and completely avoiding the blast. He was on the outside radius, and didn't even get a chance to know what was going on before the police and heroes came running in and took everyone on-scene for questioning. It really looked like it because there were plenty of people before him that said the same things, looked just as confused, looked just as disappointed that they couldn't help along the police questioning either. 

If he didn't know any better, didn't have this quirk, didn't have this job as long as he did, he would have fallen for it the same way the rest of his colleges did.

But Tsukauchi knew about liars. The better they were, the more wary he needed to be. The younger they were, the more complicated this would be. Tsukauchi had to toe this line carefully, until he learned why this kid was such a great liar. 

"I see," he said, nodding his head, "Thank you for your help. An officer will see you home-"

"It's okay," the young man replied, "Y-You need all the help you can get, right? I-I'll be okay going home alone, since nothing happened to me." 

Next to him, Sansa's tail wrapped tightly around his chairleg, out of sight from Midoriya-kun's eyes, but Tsukauchi understood that his coworker wanted nothing more than to hold the young man and tell him everything was going to be okay.

"B-But if it's at all possible!" the kid's voice climbed in poth volume and pitch, surprising them and he gave a deep bow, smacking his head on the table nad then jerking right back up. His eyes watered, but he still managed to finish his request, "W-Would it be alright if I could-coudl get D-Deatharm's autograph!"

Ah, Tsukauchi thought to himself. He wasn't lying. He truly and honestly wanted an autograph of a hero.

Even more than before, he wanted to know why he lied before then. He set an officer to keep an eye on him, just in case.

When the trail got hot, Tsukauchi didn't know whether to be happy that they had a lead, or mourn the fact that this kid was the center of this villain-warefare nightmare. 

-

They met again. 

Midoriya had an iron pole through his gut and Tsukauchi held his hand, unable to even apologize as he frantically called for a medic. It was possible, he knew it was fucking possible, for people to survive worse things. So there was no need for this kid to die. There was no way that this kid, that gave them a lead and shined at the opportunity to get a hero's autograph and lied and said that "he was okay" would die here, like this.

"I-It's okay," he rasped out.

And what killed Tsukauchi the most, had tears welling in his eyes as he desperately clutched to the kid's hand, was that the kid wasn't lying. 

"I-I'm alright," he said, blood dribbling out of his mouth, and honest. 

Tsukauchi felt his throat close up. Thought about a senpai who turned his badge after seeing too many things. All those numbers in the era of peace, but Tsukauchi was sitting with this kid, holding his hand, receieing his honest words that [everything was fine].

### izumi (endeku)

"I see, did they hurt you otherwise?" Endeavor asked eyes sharp.

Deku stared back at him, "N-no, I'm fine. And you?"

"I can't get my flames to come," he replied back, "I guess it's the same for you, if you are still here."
