### APOC

"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

### way back home

Shinso scuffed the ground with his foot. "We're-"
Midoriya, grabbing Shinso's arm with stars in his eyes, beat him to it. "We're in the same class!" 
The man stared at him, and like Midoriya's excitement was infectious, his lips wiggled and he grinned too. 
"Yeah!"
"You, me and Kacchan are all in the same class!" he cheered.
Shinso's smile fell, and he turned his head to see the sour expression on the blond. When they met eyes, the two quickly looked away from each other.
"This year is going to be so much fun!" 
"Yeah," Shinso deadpanned. "Fun."
Bakugo scowled and hissed, like a rabid dog. Heathen. Another year with him.
Midoriya, bouncing on his heels, however, looked like he was promised the whole world. It mitigated his bad mood, like an antiseptic. 
"I'm not here," the voice behind them sounded. The three turned to where Shoto frowned at the class sheets.
"You don't go to this school," Bakugo said, expression incredulous, "Why are you even here?"
Ignoring him, Shoto uncapped a marker and moved forward.
"Wait-wait!" Midoriya yelled while Shinso gaped, "Todoroki-kun, wait!"
"What are you thinking of doing with that?"
"I'll be in the same class as you, Izuku," he said, heterochromatic eyes shining, "and we'll be friends."
"We are friends, Todoroki-kun!"

-

"You did something, and as a direct result, someone else was hurt. Yes, you did something bad."
Tokoyami jerked because he didn't want to hurt them, he didn't mean to hurt them, and Midoriya's hands came to his shoulders. It should have been him, He should be the one that's comforting someone else. He should have been the person protecting, not the person that people need protecting from. He-
"But that doesn't define who you are. You don't have to let that define who you are. This isn't the end!" Midoriya yelled out. "Tokoyami-kun, I'm here! You're not alone! Neither you or Dark Shadow are bad people!"
Iida watchedwith shock and fascination as the shadow receded. Tokoyami collasped in his arms, and Midoriya's hands moved to catch him in a hug.
Their classmate cried, his hands coming to clutch around Midoriya's. Even muffled against Midoriya's body, his screaming wails rang in the silence of the room.
"I'm sorry," he cried out, "I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. I didn't want to hurt anyone."
"Yeah, I know."
"I didn't mean to hurt you! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
Midoriya rubbed circles on his back, and when the teary-eyed Dark Shadow enroached closer, opened his arm towards him and gave a gentle smile. The quirk rushed into his embrace, and started to sob in the earnest. If Midoriya was of sound mind, he might have made some notes to ask Tokoyami about how his quirk had tear ducts and tears and if that meant that he could sweat as well. However, his conciousness was starting to swim, and his arms were full of an old friend and his quirk. With how often Tokoyami came to his rescue, back when they were alive and their worst concern were pop quizzes, he was glad that he finally managed to save him once.
He waited for the tears and the screaming to stop, and when Tokoyami calmed down, he gave him a hearty pat on the back.
"C'mon, Tokoyami-kun. Let's go get cleaned up."
"Ah..." Tokoyami scrubbed at his eyes, looked up at Midoriya and his gentle smile, and took his hand shyly. "Mi-Midoriya, I-"
"Tokoyami," Midoriya cut in again, squeezing his hand, "I'm here."
His eyes watered again, and Midoriya thought it was nice to be on the other side of it for once. 

-

Iida wanted to be a Defender of Justice, just like his brother was. He wanted to protect people who were small, and weak, and not as fortunate like Midoriya. 
But in that moment, he felt frozen in his spot, and understood how far away he stood from his ideal. 

When Tokoyami stood in front of the classroom after his week suspension, he dipped his head down at the start of homeroom and earnestly apologized.
"We should be getting compensated," Kaminari shouted from the back.
Sero laughed, a mean sound that echoed in the classroom, "Yeah, I had nightmares about it! How are you going to compensate us?"
Koiichi flinched backwards, but frowned. Before he could think of anything else to say, however, someone else spoke up. 
"C'mon, Ojiro, you broke your arm, right?" Kaminari said, "And you won't be able to participate in any martial arts touneys, right? That must be awful! Surely, you agree too, right? We don't want to be in class with some ticking timebomb."
Midoriya stood up, his chair screeching behind him.
"Oh great, here comes the goody-two shoes."
And the situation was funny. He never thought that he would be happy to hear that. Because that meant, right now, the thing that people saw him for was based on his actions, not the things he couldn't control. 
Deku was not known as 'quirkless' and 'useless'. He wondered if that was proof that he was here. 
"Tokoyami-kun, my shoulder hurts."
Tokoyami flinched backwards, lifting his head and looking absolutely shocked.
"And I'm sure that Ojiro-kun is in even more pain, since he was the one that was hit so much."
Behind Tokoyami, Dark Shadow whimpered.
"Tokoyami-kun, when you apologized, what did you want?" he asked.
"I... I wanted to be forgiven."
"What does that mean to you? That you apologize and that everyone says 'okay', and then we all pretend it never happened?" 
The young man at the front of the class flinched backwards.
"What are you apologizing for? What did you want forgiveness for?"
"Because... Because I hurt you... And I didn't want to hurt you. And I'm sorry that I hurt you-" his voice cracked, and he covered his mouth. 
Midoriya turned to Ojiro, and the blond immediately dropped his gaze.
"Because I'll be honest," he said, "I'm not going to forgive you."
The teacher gasped, "Midoriya-kun!"
"You didn't hurt me," he said, ignoring the sharp glare Bakugo shot his way. "So, really, I don't think it's the class's forgiveness you're trying to earn, right? Since not all of us were hurt."
The light shined in Tokoyami's eyes.
"Wait, what?" Kaminari frowned, "I don't get it."
"It means that the only people that compensation are those who were directly hurt."
"What? What kind of bullshit-"
"Because Tokoyami wanted forgiveness for hurting someone," Midoriya said. "So people like us are irrelevant." He gave a sweet smile. And turning to the front, gave Tokoyami a wide grin.
"...I think that's a wonderful outlook to have," the sensei said. He turned to Tokoyami, "Go ahead and take a seat. I think you know what you need to do now, right?" 
And they started the day of lectures. 

-

"You'll never meet someone as condescening at him," Shoto said. 
"Con...condescending?"
"There's no one equal to him, so he looks down on everyone. He pretends like he knows better, and everyone else just looks like small children."
He sighed.
"It's frustrating," he shook his head. "I want to be his friend, but he says that it's fine." 

-

"I can save the world," Midoriya said, grabbing All Might's hand. "If I can save you, I can save the world!"
The blond stared, mouth open in gobsmacked horror.
"Who are you?"
And Midoriya felt his heart clench painfully. Wasn't it obvious? Somehow, hearing the question from All Might made everything even more painful.
"A hero!" he said, a grin on his face, "So don't worry! I am here!"
He looked at him like he was crazy, and Midoriya laughed. 
Crazy?
Crazy would be seeing All Might and choosing not to help. 

### limited collection

"It's not going to last," Dabi shrugged back, "Humans don't live that long. what's wrong with enjoying what I find every now and then?"
He leaned back against the tree trunk and yawned. 
"He's different, but not that different. With time, I'll find a new one."
Arms folded so his hands were behind his head, he hummed. 
"It's not that special."

-

"So, do you like him or do you hate him?" Dabi asked, stretching out. "I don't normally care about your pitiful human feelings, but this is starting to get annoying." 
Aizawa stared at the fire for a moment longer. Or rather was staring through the fire and glaring at Dabi's hand, and where it sat on Midoriya's head. 
He didn't answer, and Dabi snorted.
"Make your choice," he said.
"What's it to you?"
"...Nothing," the man said, even though his posture relaxed when Midoriya pressed a little more against his hand. "It means nothing to me."
Aizawa's jaw tightened. "Liar."
"Pot, kettle."
The two sat in silence for a moment longer, broken only when Midoriya murmured something. Without hesitating, Dabi paused to pull his blanket over his shoulder and back up to his chin. Dropping a hand to green hair, he ruffled them this way and that, he gave a smile when Midoriya's lips curled into a pleased smile. He snorted, "Humans are so simple. You don't even live that long, why complicate it so?"
The slave remained silent.
"The way mortals can't understand immortals, I can't imagine you understand."
"Hmm," Dabi hummed back, "Then back off." 
Eyes so cold it seemed to pierce through the fire with an icy stare, he stared at Aizawa.
"If you don't have that much time left, stop taking up his."
Jaw clenched so tightly that it ached, Aizawa kept his eyes on the fire.

-

"You already have a short life!" Dabi yelled in his face, grabbing Midoriya's arm, "You're already going to leave me behind so stop trying to leave sooner!"
The young human blinked at him.
"You..."
Dabi blinked. Rubbing his fingers on the man, it was clear. The young man wasn't injured, just covered in blood and soot. He opened his mouth, and after a few seconds, found his voice.
"You're fine," he said.
Midoriya nodded again.
And then, Dabi's face flushed red, probably realizing what he said, but he tried to pull away, Midoriya's hand grabbed his wrist. He turned away completely, so the young man couldn't see his face, but he didn't try to wrench his hand out of his grip.
"I'm still here," Midoriya said.
"Yeah, whatever. Let go."
"No."
Dabi whipped around, pupils turning to slits as smoke started to come out of his mouth. His lips pulled down into a scowl, he looked ready to yell when Midoriya yanked him forward. He dropped a few inches and Midoriya kissed him square on the lips.
He leaned back, eyes bright as he grinned.
"I'm glad you're okay."
Dabi's eyes returned into something more problem, and the smoke and fire faded like it never happened. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. 
"Yeah," he said, leaning in to speak against Midoriya's lips, "whatever."

-

Aizawa stood, a few feet away, where he abruptly stopped from running. Far away in his head, he wondered why he ran when he knew that Midoriya wouldn't be phased by this. He wondered, and the longer he wondered about an answer he didn't want, the heavier his shoulders felt. 
If Midoriya died, he would die. His [slave contract] would ensure it. 
But he didn't want Midoriya to die. 
The answer was standing in front of him, and Aizawa chose not to acknowledge it.

-

Dabi frowned. 
"Are you okay?" Midoriya asked, immdiately catching onto his mood.
"How come you can punch a hole through a monster like this," Dabi said, pointing at the High Orc on the ground, "but you limp after two rounds?"
A hot flush crossed Midoriya's cheeks. "W-wha-"
Dabi turned over, and gave him a contemplative look. "Is it a level thing?"
The young man covered his face with his arms, uncaring about how the blood smeared on his face.
"Aw sweetheat, I'm not saying it to make you feel bad," he purred out, stepping closer. He grabbed Midoriya's wrists and tugged them up higher so that Midoriya's lips were availiable for a kiss, and his arms were still covering his eyes. Against his lips, he murmured, "But I do hope you grow taller, my back hurts."
"T-That's a little out of my control!" Midoriya spluttered back. "L-Let go!"
Dabi hummed, "I don't want to," he said, using his other hand to wrap around Midoriya's waist and pulling him close. "C'mon, let's dance."
"Wait, I'm covered in orc blood! You'll get covered in it too!"
Dabi laughed. Pulling back, he released the young man. "Are you serious?" he asked, "That's your concern?"
Midoriya frowned back, "It smells bad," he said. 
The light danced in his eyes, lifted his shoulders just a little more.
"It... It wasn't that funny," Midoriya said quietly.
"It's not," Dabi confirmed for him. "This situation is." He stared at him for a moment longer and then reached out to ruffle his hair. "Don't think too hard about it," he murmured, leaning in for another kiss. 
And maybe Midoriya would have forgotten it, but when he reached up to bunch his shirt in his hands, Dabi gave a breathless laugh against his lips and he pulled back.
"You can't tell me not to think about it and then do things that will make me think about it."
Dabi looked at him, his shoulders shaking and his lips in a wide grin as he leaned in and rubbed their noses together. 
"Haha, sorry, sorry," he said, totally unrepentant. "I'll make it up to you, okay?" He pressed a kiss to his nose, and gave a wide grin. "You just make me happy."
And if he thought that by being sweet, Midoriya would let this go, he was absolutely right. Blushing more, the young man dropped his gaze.
"I'm letting this go just once," he flustered, like he didn't let Dabi go of everything. "O-Okay?"
"I'm flattered," the man purred back, dipping his head forward, either as a mock bow or to kiss his neck or both. 
Midoriya shivered when he felt sharp teeth against his skin.
"Maybe we should move this somewhere else," he said.
"Maybe we should keep moving," Aizawa's bitter tone mmade Midoriya jump. "Master."
Shamefully, Midoriya hung his head, "R-Right," he said. He looked up at Dabi, his eyes lingering on his lips and when he looked back up, blushed darker at the grin he was sent. "L-Let's go."
Aizawa, with a glare that would have set a lesser man quailing, scowled at Dabi before he turned back around. His hand shot out to grab his Master's arm, steadying him before he fell.

### returning a gift
"I.. what?"
"I said that I'll go with you," Stain said, a frown on his face, "How many times are you going to make me say it?"
"But you... That mean you can't be Stain anymore," Midoriya said.
"Yeah. I know."
"Do you?" The man shook his head. "Do you really undestand what's going on? You can't do your own thing anymore! You'll have to bow your head to other people, play in the hierarchy, take orders! Your independence, your freedom, all of it will be gone!" The man reached out, grabbing him by the front of his shirt. "You'd let it go? You'd let all of that go?"
Stain's hands came to his, engulfing his fists with ease.
"Yes," he said, "I thought you were trying to recruit me. You're a terrible recruit."
"But if you come, it'll be under my name."
"Yes," Stain nodded, "that's why I agreed."
"But you won't," he shook his head, "Then it'll be me. The person you kill for. The person you die for-"
"Yes, Izuku," Stain nodded, "I'd even live for you."
Eyes watering, Midoriya gave a loud sniffle. He hung his head. "I won't let you go. You'll never be happy. You'll live with your disappointment day in and day out. I'll work you to the bone and you won't even rest in death."
And Stain chuckled, a rich sound that vibrated in Midoriya's fists.
"I can't wait," he said. "Boss."
Midoriya's head snapped up, and Stain's hands came to grab his face. His grip was relentless.
"I've been waiting for this," he said, "For a long time."

### Dark Continent

"Geez, humans, you really don't know anything."
And Midoriya, just happy to be called human, beamed back.

-

"Well, looks like you'll always get visitors," Eraserhead said, "So we're putting you at the remote corner of the land."
He tapped the thin box in Midoriya's hand. "Use this to call someone if you need help. You know how to use a phone, right?"
Midoriya blinked owlishly back.
Eraserhead nodded, "We'll start there then," he said.

-

Not even two days later, Present Mic was sitting on his desk.
"You haven't used it at all," the blond whined. "I was so lonely."
"I-I thought it was for emergencies," Midoriya replied.
"You don't miss me?" he pouted back. Hands came to his hips and Midoriya flushed back. He gave a grin, "You can use this to call me whenever. Not just emergencies."
"To... To just... say anything?" the young man replied.
The older man released his hips to grab his hands.
"Yeah!"
"So when... When I just want to hear your voice?"
His gaze softened and he leaned in to kiss his forehead. "If you ask me to come, I'll come running."
"It's ... like a summoner," he muttered.
"It's a way for us to communicate over long distance," Present Mic amended. "A way for me to be with you without me being next to you." He leaned in closer, kissing his cheek and then the shell of his ear. When Midoriya shivered, he grinned even wider. "I get lonely when I don't get to see you. What about you?"
He was so cute when he was flushed like this. Yamada just couldn't get enough. 
"I-I missed you too," Midoriya said quietly, against his shoulder. Thin arms wrapped around his chest, and he added, "A lot."
With a wide grin, he returned the hug. Hands on his back, he hummed.
"Aw Listener," he purred, absolutely delighted when Midoriya shivered under his words.

-

Midoriya stared at Shigaraki for a long moment before his features melted into a warm smile.
"Yes," he said, a gaze so warm that he felt petrified for the moment, "I was lucky that I was captured by you."
And Shigaraki felt that aching emptiness inside of him start to fill. It didn't make any sense to him, that the ache he had for as long as he could remember, could be filled by something as small and insignificant as this small human's smile.
He stared for a long moment, before he scowled. 
"If you really thought that, then you wouldn't have escaped," he grouched out.
Midoriya didn't respond, and Shigaraki hated how he was holding onto his words.
"Don't you have something to say to me?" he asked, unable to handle the silence any longer.
Midoriya blinked at him slowly and then smiled. "Travel safely."
"Are you sending me away already?" he hissed.
The young man laughed, "You'll come back, right?"
Shigaraki sucked his cheeks in, eyes wide before he scowled instead. Turning around, he stormed out. 
He made it out by a few feet before he turned back around. Midoriya tilted his head, curious on what made him stop, and blinked owlishly when Shigaraki stormed right back. He grabbed Midoriya by the shoulder, not nearly as harshly as he used to, but the grip was just as tight.
He leaned down and kissed him, chapped lips chastly landing on his lips before he pulled back just as fast. With a blush brighter than the sun at dusk, running from the tips of his ears to the base of his neck, Shigaraki turned around and left just as fast.
Fingers coming up to his lips, Midoriya wondered how his heart could pound so fiercely from such a gentle touch.

-

"Izuku...?"
Even among the slaves, Midoriya was nothing special to look at. He was, however, enduring. So instead of a slave made for sex or work or anything, he became a little experiement. Their special playtime. 
He took a deep breath. Now was the time. To use his former training for something else. It was his choice. It was actually his choice. 
He smiled, because if he touched him, Endeavor would know that it was all a bravado.
"I-I'm excited," he lied, the familiar feeling of fear coiling in his gut. "So just," he motioned at the man, "Uhm, lay back?"
He gulped. Was that how free people spoke? 
Endeavor arched an eyebrow at him and laid back. "Like this?"
And fuck the man was massive. He was half-hard, laying on his back, and Midoriya's steps slowed. He would be okay, he knew that. He had worse inside of him, on several occasion. And unlike everything before...
"Izuku?"
He wanted Endeavor to feel good. It wasn't about his survival. 
His fingers reached out for him and got to work. He licked his lips, this won't be hard. He could do it. He grasped Endeavor with both hands, eyes landing on the older man's face when he gave a sharp intake of air. It looked like it didn't feel bad. 
"...You-"
He didn't want to hear it. 
He licked his lips as he got on to the bed. He had it all figured out. It had been some time, and Endeavor was a large man, so he tried to stretch himself a little. Not too much, because the only praise he ever recieved was that he was tight, and if all else failed, the blood would made it easier. He'd face away from the man, so that the man wouldn't be distracted and inevitably got turned off when he realized how ugly Midoriya actually was. All of his clothes fit a little baggey, but it wouldn't show the worst of his scars. 
Struggling to straddle the massive man, he hoped that he didn't look too much like a fool. Or maybe that would be better. Even if it was frustratingly bad, Endeavor could have a laugh. He lifted his hips, lined up the large man, and a pair of hands grabbed his hips.
"Izuku," Endeavor sounded breathless. "What are you doing?"
"I..." Midoriya looked lost between the man and what he was doing, "Sex?"
Endeavor's grip on his hips tightened, and Midoriya wished he understood what was going on.
"You need to... prepare your body. And stretch it. I... I'm not a small man, nor am I impatient," he said, sitting up and pulling Midoriya into his lap. He wrapped his arms around Midoriya's chest and rested his chin over the young man's shoulder. "Having you already fulfills my greatest fantasy," he murmured, "There is no rush."
Midoriya could hardly believe it, how kind could a single man be?
"I-"
His voice caught, tears streaming down his face as the guilt started to press down on his chest. 
He wasn't even human. They treated him this well, this kindly, because of that single lie. If they knew, if they really knew what the mark branded into his body was about, why the bracelet on his ankle couldn't be removed, what was done to his body before he got here, he wondered what kind of retribution would be collected from him. 
He smiled, because it would be far kinder than anything he deserved. 
"It's okay," he said, "I don't mind. I want to make you feel-"
Endeavor grabbed his face, and kissed the back of his neck. Midoriya shivered, but he didn't hat ethe sensation. He didn't know what to do with that thought.
"If you can tell me that you want me. And you mean it. That's when I'll love you till morning light," he said, "Not when you don't mind it."
Endeavor, so hard he was leaking a little, pulled Midoriya down to lay next to him. He kissed his temple, then his cheek, pulled the covers up and laid down.
"But you're-"
"Tired," he replied back. "So. Sleep."

### make believe 

Midoriya waved the shirt over his head. "Look! Look! I did it! I got all the blood off! And it smells good!" he exclaimed. He brought it up to his nose, taking a big whiff and then pushed it towards Hawks, "Ta-da! Smell this! You'd never guess that we went into a cave with it!"
The blond stared, revious nightmares casted away under the radiance of his eyes, and he laughed. Rushing forward, his arms wrapped around Midoriya and he picked him up. 
"That's great!" he exclaimed, not really getting it but totally lost when Midoriya blinded him with that grin, "Good job, Midoriya!"
The sound of Midoriya's laugh rang inside of him, and Hawks gently placed him back on the ground. He stared at him, the way his lips stretched, and he gave his wet laugh. Before Midoriya could take a step away from his embrace, he shuffled closer, wrapping his arms around him. 
"Hawks?" Midoriya's arms came around him, and Hawks didn't realize he could just tell that Midoriya was confused, from the tone of his voice and the way he patted his back, "Are you okay? Are you hungry? I'm done, so lemme put this away and we can go find Dabi to buy us lunch."
Hawks leaned back, regretfully releasing Midoriya for a second and already missing the feeling of his chest next to his. 
"Yeah, let's do that," he said, a grin on his face. 
The concern on his face melted away, and his hand grabbed his. Interlacing their hands together immediately, and Hawks felt his breath catch in his throat.
"I wanna eat meat!" he said, eyes shining, "and the lady at the pub said she'd show me how they prepare the salamanders. They were so good when we had them last time. You know, I would never have considered eating them before but it really is a delicacy here! And the guy at the meat shop, Tom? Remember? He said that he was really grateful that we took care of Sophie that day, and said that he'll have the dried meat ready to go when we leave later. I'm going to really miss this place when we leave," he said, swinging their hands together. "I already can't wait to come back!"
"...Me too," Hawks said, his voice quiet as he finally found the words to swirling storm inside of him from the moment Midoriya fell out of that tree. 
"Hm?"
"I'm going to miss this place too," he said. "I'm going to miss the place that made you laugh like that over laundry."
Midoriya's cheeks flushed, and he waved the shirt at him, "I-I worked really hard-"
"Yeah," Hawks laughed back, nodding his head. "I love that about you."
This time, Midoriya's blush ran from his face and to his neck and he squeaked. Hawks squeezed his hand.
"Midoriya, I don't think I've ever said it, but really. Truly. I ... I'm so glad that you're here. That we met. That you choose us."
The fluster on his face slowly ebbed, and that concern came back. He took a step closer, his free hand coming up to his face, and Hawks didn't even realize that he had the capacity to cry until Midoriya gently wiped his face with the freshly clean shirt.
"You just... washed that," he said, his chest heaving.
"And I can wash it again," he replied back, "This is more important."
The blond laughed, but it felt like hot lava burning his throat and face. He stepped closer, his free hand grabbing Midoriya's hand and pressing his face into his shirt. Soaking Midoriya's hard work with his snot and tears was a bit rude, even for his standards, but once it started, he couldn't stop it.
"I'm glad. I'm so glad I held on," he said.
Midoriya's brows pinched in their concern, and he nodded.
"It must have been hard."
"It was," the blond nodded, his wings dropping behind him from the exhaustion of just living every day. "And it was so worth it."
Midoriya pushed up onto his tippy-toes, and he pressed a clumsy kiss to Hawks' chin.
Hawks abruptly released him to wrap his arms around Midoriya. He pulled him even closer, and hooked his chin over his thin shoulder.
"I love you," he said, feeling as though his body would break under the weight of someone else's gentle touch. "Izuku, I love you."
"I love you too, Hawks," Midoriya said, arms tight around him and probably the only thing in the world keeping him together (arguably the only person that wants him to stay here). "I'm glad you picked me up too."
