Four steps past the school gates, Midoriya suddenly came to a stop. Whipping around suddenly, he stared at the blond behind him.
"You're coming too?"
And Midoriya, who never seemed to care or even notice who or what came with them, asked Yagi with so much incredulous shock that the blond flinched backwards. 
"I uh... Yes?"
Midoriya stared at him for a moment and then at himself. He hesitated, and then then started to head back to the school.
"...What?" 
The rest of the patrol group stood in shared shock. Do they just, keep moving? Like Midoriya did? Did they wait? Groups that went on their own usually left by themselves, whenever they felt like it, so the remains were poele that liked traveling with Midoriya (regardless if the young man wanted him or not). 
"Are... Are you kidding me?" Aizawa hissed out, "That's it? That's all we had to do to keep him here?"
"Uh, is patrol cancelled?" Hojo asked, "I... I really don't want to explain this to Chisaki-san. Should we just leave anyways?"
In their confusion and with limited information, they stood there and waited instead.
"I.. did I do something?" Yagi asked quietly, walking up to Aizawa with a wild look in his eyes.
"Shouldn't I be asking you that?" the older man hissed back.
Just when their confused silence was about to turn even more awkward, however, Midoriya returned. With a bat in hand, really reminesent of Before they learned who he was, he came back. He shot Yagi a glance.
"Stay in the back," he told him, and moved to the front. Without looking at the rest of them, he moved on. 
"Okay, what the hell was that all about?" Twice chided him as he came to the front. "Really thought we were going to kill him. // Better save him!"
As always, Midoriya ignored him.

"Are you joining us from now on?" Midoriya asked.
"Ah... I was planning on it," Yagi said. The weight of the gun on his back wasn't familiar, but if it was something that he could do to help, then... 
"Alright," the young man nodded. "I'll keep that in mind."
The blond stared, because it wasn't special treatment. Midoriya just wasn't the kind of person that cared about that kind of thing. Yagi hesitated for a second, before he brought it up.
"If you don't mind sharing, I was curious," he said quietly, "Is there a reason why you asked me? I didn't think that you..." he trailed off wen he realized how offensive his words would sound, but Midoriya finished his sentence.
"...would care?" he said. 
Yagi winced, but nodded.
A wry smile curled on his lips, perfectly framing a picture of a man who had long-lost his ability to laugh. The sight of it made Yagi's chest twist uncomfortably. 
"It's fine. I know what kind of reputation I have here," he said, and then moving back into their conversation, shrugged. "To answer your question, I... I didn't think you would want to see your quirk used to hurt people."
Another silence reigned on them.
"I see," Yagi said, covering his mouth with a hand. He could feel his organ churn uncomfortably, as though he could feel his heart rot away into nothing, and looked back up to Midoriya. "It must be hard," he said quietly, "to look after everyone."
"There's more than enough troubles to go around," Midoriya replied back, "No need to add more where I don't have to."
Yagi's hand trembled. Indeed, some time ago, he put people like Midoriya down for needless violence. Even now, he felt uncomfortable with the amount of gore that Midoriya was caked in, every time he returned. 
However, even though he meant well, and he was doing the man a kindness, Yagi couldn't help the incredulous feeling inside of him. Him? He needed to be looked after? The thought felt putrid. he was well-bodied. He didn't need to be looked after. Why would he need that? He was strong and powerful, even without a quirk. He-
The look in Midoriya's eyes, as he washed the blood off his hands in a bucket of bleach, stopped his words from escaping from his mouth. 

### Fgo? Housamo? au - > 

[ 
    For as long as Midoriya could remember, he's been sucked into a world just like the one he lived in, except everything was broken and rotting. Which was fine, because it was just a dream. As long as he woke up, it was fine.

    But in Midoriya's dream, even if the world came crashing down, he wasn't alone. When he was awake, he couldn't say the same thing.

]

All the windows in the corridor, in that instant, shattered. Midoriya's back hit the wall of the hallway as several other students screamed and shouted in their surprise. In the glass shards, he could see the sinister smile stretch acrpss its face-
"Midoriya?! Again?"
And trembling from a nightmare he couldn't wake up from, Midoriya could ask the same damn thing.
