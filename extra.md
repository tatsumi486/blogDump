Not for the first time, Izuku couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. He stood up and stepped back from the maps he hung around the former second-year classroom. He had hung the maps up a long time ago, but othertime, the others had added other maps as they found them as well. Eyebrows furrowed, he mentally mapped out the way patrols had been running. He thought about it, the things that were mentioned and tried to think of what wasn't. 
Eventually, he couldn't get an answer until he wrote out all the streetnames and then started to crossreference. Within a few hours, he had an answer. Getting up to his feet, he couldn't believe that no one had been checking around the small mall by southside. 
In the time it took to get out of the area and down the street, he already had four people following him. He really did wish that they had better things to do.

Enji had heard that Izuku had gotten badly injured.
