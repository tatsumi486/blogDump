Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

# kind nightmare

Aizawa fucking hated being waken up by someone slamming on the door. He was going to ruin this salesperson's day and then their lodge a complaint to someone about bothering people when they were sleeping and ignoring the door for about 30 minutes-
And all his anger slipped out of him as his eyes fell to Yamada.
"...Hey uh... Aizawa," his friend forced this smile on his face, looking up to him and then back down to the ground, "I uh... Sorry for bothering you so early. I-I know you hate being waken up-"
Aizawa took a step back.
"Come on, I'm already up anyways."

"Midoriya?"
As discreetly as possible, four people's head snapped up to the door where Midoriya was standing at the entrance of the Teachers' Lounge, where Snipe was talking to the young man.
Nemuri and Inui's eyes met, and at once, realized that they would be in charge of cleaning up whatever mess that occured.
All Might stood up, eyes bright as he seemed to look through Snipe and saw young Midoriya, but Snipe turned around and announced.
"Yamada, student!"
For a moment, Nemuri could see it with startling clarity. Standing over Yamada's grave, informing him that All Might fell after being caught as an accomplice to Aizawa for the murder of another UA teacher. She could see it and if the way Inui was staring at Kan was any indication, she was not the only person that could see that kind of future.
As heroes, they had to protect the peace. As teachers, they protected students.
"Yeah sure," Yamada stood up, probably having no idea how close to death he was. His voice dropped several pitches, and Nemuri heard his quiet and gentle, "Hey there, Midoriya-kun. What's up?" And felt cold.
The look on All Might's face when Yamada said, "Yeah, of course. C'mon, we shouldn't talk about this here-" Nemuri heard something, probably another pen, snap in Aizawa's hand, "-let's go."
And Nemuri wasn't sure if she should praise Yamada's escape speed or Aizawa's self-control. Or maybe she should be jealous of Inui, who only had to look after Kan.
"Okay," Snipe came by her desk a few seconds later, "What the hell just happened?"
Nemuri pursed her lips, not because she didn't know either but because she didn't know where to begin. 
Placing her hands on her hips, she shook her head. This has gone on long enough. 
"Aizawa," she said.
"Christ, finally," Cementoss muttered.
"What's going on with Midoriya-"
"Something's going on with Midoriya-shounen?"
All Might whipped around, intruding on the conversation at once, and Aizawa sighed.
"He's just having some problems at home," Aizawa said. "Don't worry about it."
"I wouldn't have worried about it except you, and Yamada, have been acting strange."
"We're not acting strange, it's all in your head."
"Take that bullshit somewhere else," Nemuri snapped back. "You're better than that."
"Hey, Nemuri-"
"If it's obvious enough that even we've noticed it, you think that any of the students haven't picked up on it? Of course they have. So, what's going to be your excuse then?"

"Someone that has different morals and priorities from me doesn't make them a bad person."

Midoriya closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "I don't mind," he said.
Jiro frowned, and probably a lot more irritated than she meant to, snapped out, "What?"
Midoriya looked at her with a smile. "I don't mind becoming a villain, if it means that I can save everyone else."
"...Midoriya?"
The smile on his face was the same that she saw on the first day of class. A watery smile of a kid who looked about ready to shit himself in fright. She felt her heart beat.
"Alright, I'm going rogue."
"You're what?"
"Jiro, you don't know anything. That's good."
And he got up to leave. Somehow, the thought that she would never see him again made her stomach twist.
"Midoriya, what are you-"
And in a flash of green, he was gone.

# politics -> The Enemy (lmao)

"I don't need your damn help!" Bakugo snapped back.
"I know," Midoriya replied, "I need yours."
"I... What?"

-

"Working everyday isn't good for you," Midoriya explained, "So go take a break."
"No."
