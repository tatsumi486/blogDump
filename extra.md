Four steps past the school gates, Midoriya suddenly came to a stop. Whipping around suddenly, he stared at the blond behind him.
"You're coming too?"
And Midoriya, who never seemed to care or even notice who or what came with them, asked Yagi with so much incredulous shock that the blond flinched backwards. 
"I uh... Yes?"
Midoriya stared at him for a moment and then at himself. He hesitated, and then then started to head back to the school.
"...What?" 
The rest of the patrol group stood in shared shock. Do they just, keep moving? Like Midoriya did? Did they wait? Groups that went on their own usually left by themselves, whenever they felt like it, so the remains were poele that liked traveling with Midoriya (regardless if the young man wanted him or not). 
"Are... Are you kidding me?" Aizawa hissed out, "That's it? That's all we had to do to keep him here?"
"Uh, is patrol cancelled?" Hojo asked, "I... I really don't want to explain this to Chisaki-san. Should we just leave anyways?"
In their confusion and with limited information, they stood there and waited instead.
"I.. did I do something?" Yagi asked quietly, walking up to Aizawa with a wild look in his eyes.
"Shouldn't I be asking you that?" the older man hissed back.
Just when their confused silence was about to turn even more awkward, however, Midoriya returned. With a bat in hand, really reminesent of Before they learned who he was, he came back. He shot Yagi a glance.
"Stay in the back," he told him, and moved to the front. Without looking at the rest of them, they looked on

    For as long as Midoriya could remember, he's been sucked into a world just like the one he lived in, except everything was broken and rotting. Which was fine, because it was just a dream. As long as he woke up, it was fine.

    But in Midoriya's dream, even if the world came crashing down, he wasn't alone. When he was awake, he couldn't say the same thing.

All the windows in the corridor, in that instant, shattered. Midoriya's back hit the wall of the hallway as several other students screamed and shouted in their surprise. In the glass shards, he could see the sinister smile stretch acrpss its face-
"Midoriya?! Again?"
And trembling from a nightmare he couldn't wake up from, Midoriya could ask the same damn thing.
