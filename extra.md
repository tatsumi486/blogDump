"I'm quirkless," Midoriya replied, waving his hand. 
"You don't want to change that?"
The young man laughed back, a sounds bright and small like Christmas lights on in the dead of the night. 
"No way," he said, "I don't want to be invincible."

### saying hello

Midoriya sighed as he pressed his hand against his rib. It wasn't broken, he's pretty sure, but god did it hurt. 

But more importantly, he looked over to where the small child was. 

"Are you okay?" he asked quietly, "Are you hurt?" he clarified, because there was no way the kid was okay. This kid probably just lost everyone and everything. Midoriya turned over, and his heart ached from how young he looked, wide-eyed and lanky, when the kid suddenly launched himself into his chest.

Heaving cries came out, ringing Midoriya's ears, but he still wrapped his arms around the kid. Rubbing his back in circles, he hummed quietly, hopeful that the sound of another person, their vibrations and their heartbeat, would provide some level of comfort for him. 

The kid cried and cried, his head against Midoriya's chest, and the older man rubbed his back as soothing as he could. After several minutes, the kid started to quiet down, sniffling loudly, and Midoriya ached to do this but-

"...It's not safe here," he said, "Do... Do you have someplace to be? I can walk you..." his voice trailed when he saw the way fresh tears came and pursed his lips. "I see." He took a deep breath and took a dive, "It... It won't be comfortable, but do you want to come with me?" 

"Can... can I?"

The blond looked up and sniffled again. 

"Is... Is that okay? I'm not... Not strong. Or smart or..." 

Midoriya melted. "Of course," he replied, voice quiet as to not alarm him as he nodded his head, "You can stay as long as you want." 

The tears that spilled out of his eyes and down his face weren't tears that came from someone who lost something, but someone remembering that they didn't lose everything. 

A blubbering mess, he nodded his head. Taking Midoriya's hand into a death grip, he shuffled along behind him.

Despite the situation, he smiled back. He squeezed back and quietly led him forward. In his head, he was already trying to figure out where he could get this kid to go. In his pack, he had already cleaned out all the actual soups and stuff, but hopefully, they would have something else for him to have. Hopefully.

If not, he hoped that the kid behind him would be okay with some old trail mixes. It was all Midoriya had, at this time. Hopefully, when they break into the supermarket parking lot, they could find something to salvage in the trucks.

### Extremely Bad Fortune (but Honestly Not as Bad as Expectations)

Summary: Modern-Fantasy AU. A long, long time ago, a powerless man went and fought god and won. As a result, the world was thrown into darkness and disarray. Even now, the powerless, the Quirkless, and the meritless were often viewed as a symbol of misfortune and evil. If at all possible, Midoriya Izuku would like the world to see him as a [Hero] instead a harbinger of mass-destruction. 

#### Notes:

- two types of people
  - Land of Rising Sun -> ie daywalkers/people who lived under the sun (heroes + civilians). Those who fight monsters are "heroes"
  - Land of Eternal Night -> ie nightwalkers/people who don't live under the light (our villains). Those who fight monsters are "champions"

"So when the Quirk revolution started, it was a simple thing
