### Rotting Flower

"Sorry, this probably feels excessive, but I'm at my wits end too," Hawks said, pinning Midoriya down onto the bed. With a thin wrist in each hand, the blond had his hands next to Midoriya's head as his feathers pulled his robe apart.
The blood ran out of Midoriya's face, and he frantically tried to pull his arms free.
"Stop that, I don't want to hurt you."
"Then what are you doing now?" Midoriya hissed back. He tried to kick the man, but with the blond between his legs, he just ended up flailing a little.
"I want to prove to you that I'm useful.
"I don't have any need for this!" Midoriya snapped back.
Briefly, so briefly that if Midoriya wasn't just staring at Hawks' face he would have missed it, the blond looked hurt. He opened his mouth, as though to say something, but closed it.
"Then, listen to me," he said. "Please."
Midoriya pulled at his wrist, his conscience prickling. The quiet voice in the back of his head that wanted to snap that there was no reason to feel that way since Hawks was forcing somthing on him. But Midoriya, who knew and understood that this whole world was all sorts of messed-up and painful, didn't want to add to that angony. 
Enough people have been hurt. Enough people will continue to be hurt.
"...Let me up," Midoriya said, "And I'll listen."
"Don't call your guards."
Great point, Hawks, Midoriya thought dryly. Where the hell were those guys anyways? He sighed but nodded.
"I will not call my guards. As long as you don't threaten my life."
The blond released him. Midoriya scurried backwards, until his back was to his headrest and stared warily at the blond. 
Red wings folded back against his back, stray feathers scattered around his bed like patches of sunlight filtering through the trees.
"...You're really hurting my feelings."
"Say your piece and leave."
"...I want to offer you my life."
"Denied. Get out."
The blond laughed, as he got off the bed. There was no way that it was that easy. There was no way.
"You know, the thing was, I was going to puy myself into a life contract with you."
"I don't want it. Leave."
The bold tilted his head at him, "I know that you're trying to take back the empire. I can see it."
"You know, just insinuating that could get you thrown into prison for life."
"If you want to throw me into prison for life, I won't fight it."
He gave this little half-smile, as though he didn't know how to emote grief so this was the closest he could come to. Midoriya felt his heart twist at the expression.
"I won't," he said.
"I know."
Hawks got down onto one knee in front of the bed. With his hand on his chest and head bowed, he spoke.
"I engrave my true name onto these words," he said. Magic swirled around them immensely, and Midoriya felt cold sweat roll down his spine, beacause he knew what this meant. He jerked up, trying to rush out of bed to stop the blond, but got tangled in the sheets. "My name, Takami Keigo, is yours to own and yours to use."
"No, wait-"
But it was too late. The surge of magic swelled, compressing into a tiny feather that touched Midoriya's bare leg from when his robe was midhandled. Midoriya gasped as the gentle touch sent a pulse of electicity through his leg, like getting a nasty shock after handling wool and cotton. He shivered, because the lasting aftereffects ran through his bdoy.
A hand came onto his shoulders, before he was pulled against a warm body.
"Sorry, I got excited," Hawks murmured against his head. Arms wrapped all the way around his torso before he was gently manuevured to be cradled. Red wings opened all around him like a curtain. 
A quiet whimper slipped from Midoriya's ips. 
"You're sensitive to magic, aren't you?"
The thick fog over Midoriya's head cleared just a little bit.
"Asshole," he hissed out.
"I know, I know," the blond sighed. "But you really don't give me any opportunities to win you over."
His voice rumbled out of his chest and into Midoriya's. The vibrations made his body shiver. His hands trembled as he grabbed the front of Hawks' shirt.
"But ... why?"
"Rest up," the blond murmured back, "And when you wake up, call for me."
Despite his best efforts, Midoriya's eyelids closed shut. His breathing evened out, and his magic circuits worked tirelessly to adjust and incorporate yet another source of energy inside of him.

-

Midoriya woke up with a groan.
"Are you awake, Izuku?"
The young man slowly pushed himself up. His entire body felt sore, like he had worked his muscles too hard the day before and now he was just exhausted. He rubbed at his eyes, uncaring about the way his robe slid down his shoulder, and his blanket pooled at his leg. 
"Here, water."
He took the glass from Gang Orca's hands, and he gave a sleepy, wide grin.
"Thanks, Kugo," he said. He took a gulp, and when he pulled the glass from his lips, Gang Orca had leaned in to kiss him. Barely managing to swallow the water in his mouth before Sakamata's thick tongue made it in, he gave a happy sound from the back of his throat. The older man pulled back, licking his lips provocatively.
"Slept well?"
"I'm a little sore," Midoriya replied honestly, and yawned again. "I had a terrible dream."
"A dream?" Gang Orca took the cup from him and placed it on the dresser.
"Yeah," Midoriya shook his head, "I had this awful dream where Hawks gave his life to me."
"It can't be that bad."
Midoriya gave a shireked shout. Suddenly awake, heart pounding in his chest, he placed his hands over his heart as his head snapped to the sound of Hawks' voice. Indeed, the blond was leaning against his couch, an easy smile on his face as he waved amiably. 
"Morning, Master of Mine," he said with a wide grin, "Sleep well?"
"...Oh my god," Midoriya whispered. "It wasn't a dream, was it?"
"Nope!" Hawks beamed back. "Use me well!"
"...Wh... Why?"
Because Hawks made an oath on his life. It was pretty much a curse, that would link his life to Midoriya's. If Midoriya died, or if Midoriya wanted Hawks to die, then he would die. That was it. Hawks would know when Midoriya was in danger, when his magic was erratic, when he frowned a little more than usual, and altogether, it would mean that Hawks knew too much about Midoriya.
"It doesn't require anything on your side,' Hawks said, raising both his hands.
"Of course it does!" Midoriya snapped back, his frustrations bubbling up. 
Gang Orca frowned, "Midoriya, you didn't accept it, right? Then it's just a one-sided oath-"
"How can it be one-sided when I'm not responsible for his life?!" Midoriya snapped back. 
it was one thing when he forced people into these oaths, like what he did to Dabi, and it was another thing when he boxed people so they had no choice but to make an oath, like what he did to Overhaul. Both parties knew and understood that there was nothing clean about Midoriya's methods, and they all knew how far Midoriya was going to take this.
But Hawks didn't knowt that. Midoriya didn't want Hawks to know that. He didn't want to be Hawks' cage, he didn't want to cip those wings, the Hawks he liked was the Hawks that could open his wings and fly-
"You don't have to believe me right now," Hawks said, his smile dropping, "But I want to be an asset to you. I'll spend the rest of my life proving that to you."
"But you don't need to..."
His voice trailed off when he saw Hawks grin.
"Yeah," he agreed, "I choose to. I choose you."
The [Oath] would ensure that Midoriya would be able to see through all of Hawks lies. To receive an [Oath] like this, no matter how one-sided, made his heart twist. What was the best thing to do, in this kind of situation? He stared at Hawks, and for all his confidence, looked uneasy.
Heaving a big sigh through his nose, he moved to get off the bed on the opposite side of ang Orca. Feet on the plush carpet, he gotup and adjusted his robe to better cover himself. Once he was on his feet, he turned back to Hawks.
The blond, meeting his eyes, straightened out of his normal slouch. Midoriya maintained eyecontact as he took a few steps forward. Right before his feet could hit the cold hardwood, the older man stepped forward to close their distance. 
Miodriya looked up at him, before he dropped his gaze to their feet. Taking a deep breath, he lifted his head up.
"You're too tall," he said. 
Behind him, he heard Gang Orca jerk, as Hawks descended dwon onto one knee and bowed his head forward. Not being able to hear his little quips was already starting to set a weight on his heart.
"If we go through with this, ther'es no going back."
"Yes," Hawks' answer was so short and curt. It didn't sound like him.
"You will regret this."
At that, a ghost of a smile returned to Hawks' lips as he peered up at his lord.
"I look forward to it."
Green eyes looked at him like he was already regretting it. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath. The glow of magic was unmistakable, as he extended his hand towards Hawks.
"On my True Name," Hawks' head snapped up but Midoriya didn't hesitate, "I will accept your [Oath], and bestow my blessings on you."
"Wait-"
Midoriya gave him a playful smile as his magic surrounded them like Hawks' wings did before. It encompassed them like a big hug, and Midoriya felt closer to Hawks than ever before.
"Let's get along well, Hawks."
Two could play at this game.
The blond blinked before a loud laugh came out of him, as soon as the magic settled and their [Oath] printed on their souls and bound their lives together, he rushed up to his feet. One arm looped around his waist as the other hand came up to his face. The blond was fast, already pressing their lips together. With the [Oath] still fresh, their magic curled around each other intimately. 
Midoriya gave a choked cry, but it felt good. His hands came up and around Hawks' neck. He opened his mouth with a low moan, as Hawks' tongue pushed in with. Right when Midoriya felt like he would pass out from the lack of oxygen, Hawks released a laugh. it was a breathless laugh pressed right against Midoriya's tongue, and it tasted sweet. 
That was, until he felt something wet on his cheeks. Eyelids fluttering open, he stared in gobsmack shock because there were tears running down Hawks face.
"Thank you," he whispered, resting their foreheads together, "Thank you. I'll prove my use to you."
And Midoriya wondered if he could save someone from himself.

-

"...Is... everything alright?"
Gang Orca's fingers stilled from where he was tracing through the book. Was midoriya talking to him? Was this a test?
He turned to where earnest green eyes peered up at him curiously.
"...Have I done something to upset you?"
Of course it wasn't a test. Midoriya wasn't that kind of person. It was why Gang Orca worked so hard for him.
Green eyes searched his features while he reached out to his arm. Warm fingers pressed against his cool skin, and Gang Orca leaned into the touch. He gave a deep, long sigh.
"Why did you give him your blessings?" Gang Orca asked at last. 
Normally, it was unheard of for someone as lowly as him to even ask. Under normal circumstances, he didn't even deserve to even talk to him. There was no possible way for someone like him to even dream of understanding Midoriya. 
Still.
"...He swore on his True Name, his life and ambition to follow mine. It felt like it was the least I could do-"
"The least you could do?" Gang Orca snapped back, "The least you could do was to accept that scoundrel into your heart? Let him dirty your mana-"
"He's not dirty," Midoriya cut him off. His voice firm, gaze even, he repeated himself again. "He's not dirty."
It made the older man's heart twist. Certainly, Midoriya was completely ignorant to how his words stormed into Gang Orca's heart, kicking down the walls he had painstakingly build over the years.
"And if he is, then we are of the same now. That's what it means ot be his Master."
He pulled his hand away from Gang Orca.
"Is that what the problem was? That you didn't approve of him?"
And feeling vulnerable in a way he hasn't been since he was a child being hauled around in chains, he shook his head.
Midoriya wasn't wrong. The problem wasn't that he accepted Hawks. The problem wasn't the fact that He accepted someone as dirty as Hawks to be worthwhile to share his mana and share his future with.
"...Then what? You've been acting strange. You and everyone, actually. Yagi won't meet my eyes. Dabi hasn't stopped by. What's going on?" 
Sakamata stared at him for a moment and took a deep breath. 
"It's stupid."
"I'll decide that."
"I don't want you to lower your opinion of me."
"I will if you start to keep things from me."
He arched an eyebrow at him, as though to dare Gang Orca to challenge him.
"... I wanted to give you my [Oath] too."
Midoriya slowly blinked at him. 
"...What?"
"You accepted his [Oath], and went as far as to give him a [Blessing], even though I've been here longer."
"Huh?"
Sakamata shrugged back.
"It's not fair."
"...Oh."
A moment of silence fell on them, as Midoriya's jaw unhinged in his disbelief.
"That's why?"
"...I'm sorry," Gang Orca replied back, closing his eyes. I-"
Midoriya's hand came to his arm, and he leaned in to kiss him on his shout. The taller man stiffened under the contact, surprised and still like a shadow.
"Thanks for telling me," Midoriya said. "I thought that it was reserved for knights and stuff. I didn't realize that iy would bother you, any of you, this much."
Gang Orca remained quiet. 
"You would accept my oath?" he asked, feeling as though he was waiting for the carpet to be pulled out from under his feet. 
"Only if you accept my blessings."
And the thought lingered in his head before, but it came back at full force in these moments. He leaned in for a kiss, and Midoriya met him halfway.
There wasn't anything that he wouldn't accept from Midoriya. Was it loyalty? Was it devotion? Gang Orca didn't have a word for it, but if he had to choose one...

### Simple Scenario

[Scenario: Beast Within.]
[Difficulty: C]
[Summary: If Sakamata loes himself to his inner beast, kill him.]
[Reward: 5000 Coins]

"Don't look at me!'"
Midoriya flinched at the loud sound, feeling the sound rattle his bones inside of his body,. Even though he could feel each and every single cell in his body scream at him to run away, run far, far away, he took a step coser instead.
"Stay away! Go away!"
His steps stopped a few feet away from the hulking whale of a man. it must be hard, to suddenly stop being human. Where Enji had burns lacing his arms and Hawks felt like his back was tearing apart, Sakamata simply stopped looking like he was human.
"What is it?! What do you want?! Just leave!"
Midoriya was given very simple instructions at the start of all of this. That Yagi Toshinori was his goal. He had to protect Yagi Toshinori, and that this Yagi-man would save the world. He understood that, and he wasn't going to back down on that promise.
To stay and try to save each and every single person around him wasn't going to happen. It wasn't feasible. It wasn't likely. It would be too much work for absolutely nothing in return. There was no point to it. There was a beter use for that kind of effort.
Still.
"Thank you for saving me."
There was a long pause. For a brief moment, it felt like his words casted a spell to stop time. Around them, the whispering, the crying, the mourning, seemed to pause just a little bit.
He gave a full bow.
"I won't ever forget this," Midoriya added. "If we run into each other again, please don't hesitate to reach out. I will take your hand."
"Doesn't it scare you?" Sakamata asked, turning around slowly. The head of an orca whale looked back at him, webbed fingers as he reached towards Midoriya.
"Everything scares me," Midoriya said, "But I need to keep moving forward."
He must have had a hard time, Midoriya thought, because his shoulders started to tremble. An underwater earthquake must be like this, as a great quake ran through Sakamata.
"And you? What are you moving to?"
"I'm looking for someone," Midoriya said. "And I need to find him."
[Scenario Complete!]
[Check Inventory for your Reward.]
It felt cheap, to think that this man's life could have a cost. And that Midoriya, who would take these coins to make himself stronger, was just as dirty for using the cost of life like this.
He rubbed his shoulder a bit, but deciding that this was it. This was all he could do, bcause he had other htings to do, turned on his heel.
"Wait."
He turned around, staring at him curiously. 
"...Are you... going alone?"
"If I have to."
"That... doesn't scare you?"
"It does."
Sakamata stared for another moment. He opened his mouth, but failed to make any noise. 
"Then... why?"
"Because I'm looking for someone. And that's more important than being afraid."
"The person you're looking for could be dead."
The thought occured to Midoriya before. It made his heart heavy as he remembered the tender smile of a man who looked too much like him. 
"They could also be alive," he countered back, "And waiting for me to find them."
Were they done now? Could Midoriya leave?
"Okay," Sakamata nodded. "Let's go." He got up to his feet. 
"Let's... go?" he parroted.
The whaleman nodded. "Let's go," he repeated. "I'm coming with you."
"What?" the young man blinked, suddenly flustered, he shook his head, "No, wait, are you sure? We just met!"
An amused smile stretched Sakmata's lips. "Yes."
"And there's no garuntee that we'll live just because we are togther. The nxt one could make us kill each other!"
"Yes. You said his name was Yagi Toshinori?"
"But... But... Are you sure?"
Sakamata chuckled, a sudden sound that made the air tremble.
"Yeah."
And that was it. Nothing more to be said. Sakamata picked up a metal pipe off the ground and moitioned at Midoriya.
"So, which way?"

[Scenario: Poison Fog]
[Difficulty: B]
[Summary: A poisonous fog covers the City. Destroy it at the source.]
[Reward: 10000 Coins]

The words echoed in his head as they made their way through the desolated city. The plan was to raid a convienence store, and make it to the train station. Grab anything of use, but the focus was food and water. 
While running with plastic bags filled to the brim and packed backpacks, Midoriya saw her.
A woman, laying face-down, crawling forward. Giant ears, reminding Midoriya of a rabbit, sat on her head. Briefly, their eyes met, and he could see her lips move.
[I'm still alive.]
His pacing kept up with the others, but even a few steps later, he could still see her figure with startling clarity.
He came to an abrupt stop, nearly falling from how hard he tried to turn around. 
"Izuku?!" the startled cry came out.
"Keep going!" he yelled back, feeling the poison already seep onto his skin. A few seconds here and he felt like he was going to vomit, and the world was spinning all around him.
He couldn't imaginge how awful it must feel for that lady.

### Pansy

Alone, Shennong thought, he was okay being alone. He thought and believed it, until that hand slid into his, and with a wide grin on her face, tugged him along to view the starry skies from the flower field. He should have been okay, being alone.
Wrapping an arm around her, his human, he rubbed his face alongside her. She giggled, a bright sound that he could encase in his heart so he would be reminded of a time when he wasn't alone.
