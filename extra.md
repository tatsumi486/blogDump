>>endeku: where Hawks sees how gentle Endeavor has become?

Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

# witch's house

Midoriya's eyes widened, because right when he should have died, he saw Dabi run. A flash of blue for the monster and he saw it.
Dabi's face, wide-eyed shock as he reached to grab Midoriya.
"You're fine," he said, his voice trembling. "You're fine so just- just-"
Midoriya opened his mouth. Thank you, he wanted to say. Because he wanted to be proven wrong. More than anything else, this was what he wanted to be wrong about. Blood dribbled out of his mouth, but Midoriya felt happy. The vacancy in his chest cavity and the pain in his chest didn't feel like anything.
"Stop-" Dabi gasped out, "Stop trying-"
He didn't get the rest of the words, but Midoriya was grateful.
Dabi did care. Dabi had the capacity to care.
That was enough for Midoriya.
He woke up with a gasp, rolling on his side, he coughed twice, dry-heaving in the corner.
"Easy," the voice above him encouraged. "It's okay."
"Yeah," Midoriya nodded, and looked up to grin widely at Hawks. "It-it's good. It's okay."
Being wrong, Midoriya thought, was the best thing ever. 
The blond, more than times when Midoriya woke up screaming and crying and inconsolable, looked confused and a little worried.

-

What determined the use of a person? Why was it, that when some people died, he was sent back to the beginning of the floor, but when other people died, they moved on.
Wait, Midoriya realized.
Did that mean, if he cleared this floor without Dabi, Dabi would be dead-dead? That Midoriya and the others would move on to the next floor without them? That they would be fine and they would just have to deal with the fact that someone died?
Somehow, that thought made him even more bitter. How could that be, he wondered. Because sure, he didn't like Dabi. And yeah, Dabi didn't like him much either. And the others didn't seem to get along. Even now, it didn't seem like they were mourning his loss.
So wasn't this okay? Wasn't it fine? Maybe it was better like this.
His steps slowed to a stop, and in front of him, Hawks' expression morphed into a confused kind of shock. He stared at the blond and he smiled. 
"Midoriya?" he said, quiet at first and as the realization sank in, his hands came flat against where the doorframe was, as though there was a transparent glass between them. "Midoriya!" he yelled out.
He banged on the window. 
"Midoriya! Run!"
"Everyone gets out alive," Midoriya said, "and we all go together."
Hawks ran back through the door, but it didn't matter. Midoriya turned around and looked up at the monster, and watched the open maw blur towards him. Teeth sank into him, the crunch of bones and Midoriya woke up screaming.
He turned on his side, his hand at his shoulder and Hawks' hands grabbed his shoulders. 
"Midoriya!" he yelled out, his voice so different from the way he yelled Midoriya's name just a second ago.
He gasped and heaved, the pain receding away like it never happened, because it hadn't happened yet, and he covered his face. Tears running down from his eyes, his chest heaved with the effort to fill his lungs and empty them again.
"Hey, hey, it's okay," Hawks said, holding him down. "Look at me. Okay? You're okay."
Midoriya nodded his head. It was okay. It was going to be okay.
And if they weren't okay, that was fine, because Midoriya would do it as many times as it took.

# withering 

"Yeah, I..." Hawks voice trailed off. He reached forward, his hand touching Midoriya's neck and pulling his shirt down a little. Midoriya, feeling like his innocence was about to be threatened, gulped. "This is new."
And in Hawks' hand was the very nice and very expensive-looking necklace that Endeavor had gotten him.
"Y-yeah?"
Hawks was smiling, but it didn't reach his eyes. It made Midoriya's knees knock together, wondering if he could run and outrun Number Three Hero. He gulped audibly. 
"Uhm."
"Hm," he said, "Didn't know that you liked this kind of thing." 
His fingers trailed up to his ears. His thumb and index finger grabbed onto his earlobe, and he flashed him a wide grin.
"What do you think about earrings?" he asked. "I think you'll look great."
Midoriya gave a quiet gasp, and felt Hawks grin against his lips before his tongue forced its way into his mouth. A heat licked up from the bit of his stomach up to his cheeks, and he leaned into it. He wouldn't mind being boiled alive, if it meant that this would be the last thing that he felt.
"You're hot," Hawks whispered against his ear, pulling back with a frown. He placed a hand on his head. "Are you okay?"
Midoriya grabbed him by the front of his shirt and tugged him closer.
"Would you save me if I said no?"
The blond kissed him on the cheek.
"I'd save you regardless," he said, "at my fastest."
And Midoriya's heart swelled. Being saved by Hawks must be a wonderful feeling, he thought to himself. He laughed, a bright sound to match the way the fever burned inside of him. 
"I can't wait."
Hawks laughed back, arms tight around his waist. 
And Midoriya got his ears pierced. 

-

"...You got them pierced." 
Midoriya jolted when he felt Dabi's cold fingers against his ears.
"God, why are your hands so cold?" he hissed back, grabbing his fingers and placing them next to his neck. "Geez," he sighed, reaching for Dabi's other hand. "Come on, give 'em over."
"...You know most people would try to avoid it altogether," he said.
And the young man laughed, "Why are you talking about most people like you know more than three?"
Dabi pulled one of his hands back to hit him upside the head.
"Shithead," he muttered back. "And answer my question," he said, bringing his hand to Midoriya's ear. "When'd you get them done?"
"I got them done with a friend."
"You don't have friends?"
"I'm not you Dabi, I'm weak. Of course I have friends."
"Bullshit."
"Are you jealous?"
"If I were," and the hands next to his head started to get very hot, "then it'd be gone."
"Good thing demons don't feel jealous," Midoriya replied, a coy smile on his face.
"Do you ever wish that I wasn't a demon?" Dabi asked suddenly. "What if I'm actually a human?"
The young man looked at him for a moment, a hundred questions in his head, but one seemed to be louder than the others.
"I'd ask you if you really thought that. The person that'd lose more is you, isn't it? Is that really what you want?"
Dabi was quiet for another moment and then laughed. "Idiot," he said, "it was just a fucking joke."

"So he's like what, a pack omega?"
And against all logical thought process, Aizawa's heart jumped at a stupid fantasy where Izuku looked at him and smiled. A ridiculous notion where Izuku would look at him and see him and smile, like Aizawa's features and life and being was anything worth smiling about.
"No," he said, answering promptly. His tone must have fluctuated a little, because Yamada gave him a concerned look. From the others' expression, no one else seemed to notice.
"No... Wait, he's free?"
The stranger got a big grin on his face, and a wave of excitement seemed to ripple among the strangers. 
"Unbonded?"
"Wait, wait, he's untouched, right? Then, anyone can break him in, right?"
Aizawa paused, his good mood grinding down into nothing as he tried to keep his expression clear.
He didn't need to do anything, as Shigaraki stepped forward and grabbed the front of the stranger's shirt. 
"Say that again, you shithead."
"Whoa!" the stranger gasped, "Chill out, dude! It's fair right? He's fair game, ain't he? He's not yours so what the hell is it to you?"
Shigaraki shook him again, his lips pulled back into a scowl. His eyes were wide, the exuding aura of an alpha spilling out towards them. 
"Nothing," Shigaraki said, "I'm just in the mood to kill you."
"Wha-"
"Shigaraki," Aizawa said, but he had a hard time disagreeing. The rational part of his brain, the part that became a hero to protect people, rebelled hard, but it felt like he was losing it to the black-hole his instincts were.
"You wanna stop me? Just try."
And Aizawa, who caught Izuku smiling yesterday when he was reading, remembered how fast that smile disappeared as soon as the man caught eye of him, felt his heart sting. For every one step he took, he felt like they took three steps back whenever guys like this appeared.

-

"And... and you're not angry?"
Izuku looked up at Aizawa, and then back down. Figuring that this was the end of their discussion, Aizawa hid his disappointment and continued to shelf the files.
"I was," Izuku admitted, surprising him. 
"Yeah?" he prompted.
"It's annoying," the young man continued. "Not them, but me."
"You?" Aizawa frowned,just barely managing to stop himself from yelling and shouting because Izuku was anything but.
"I always think that it's not going to bother me," he said, covering his eyes with his hand, "and that I don't care but clearly..." His voice trailed off. With a deep sigh, he pushed his hand through his hair. "...I just hate how weak it makes me feel."
Weak. Aizawa had never considered that word with Izuku. He turned around, fully intent on making his thoughts clear, but held his tongue. He doubted that the young man was just fishing for some compliments, and no matter how Aiawa actually felt, it was clear that Izuku would only hear it as a half-hearted compliment.
"I understand," he said at last, "It's a frustrating feeling." He put the files onto the shelf. "No matter what we try, if you feel something, you feel something. What you can control is what you're going to do about it." He took a deep breath and took a step back, meeting Izuku's eyes. "And I think you've done above and beyond with that."
"...Like, plus ultra?"
Aizawa's eyebrows twitched, but the smile on his face was unmistakable.
"Yeah. Plus Ultra."
And Izuku gave this breathless sound, and for all the time that Aizawa had spent with him, he wondered if he was finally, finally laughing. 
An honor. 

-

"After Izuku mentioned it, I can't help but notice it. It's really fucked," Kaminari said, uncaring about the stink-eye he got from for cursing, "Like, they didn't care about anything before, and as soon as they heard that Izuku's unbonded, they're suddenly helping out and all that."
"Kaminari," Shoji's voice came as a warning, because no matter how much he agreed with the statement, there was no need to get any more upset about it. At the end of the day, they still had work to do. "Save it for later."
"Yeah, but doesn't this just annoy you?"
"It does," his friend replied, "That doesn't mean we can't work with it."
Kaminari frowned, and Shoji looked back forward.
"We have our orders. Let's clear it out and go home. all of us."
His tone turned softer, and Kaminari rubbed the back of his neck.
"Ah!" one of the new strangers, who used to look so scared but now gave them a wide grin, his scent flaring out as though it would make any of them flinch. "There you pups are! Come on, break time is over! You guys gotta work if you wanna be," he flexed his arms, "as strong as me!"
"Dish-duty that Stain gets to him first," Kaminari said.
"Laundry on Hawks," Shouji replied.
The two exchanged a look, and shared a wry grin.

"Oh, so you're being courted!"
Izuku, who ripped the remains of his shirt off, didn't even look at the man as he grabbed his backpack and slung it over his shoulder. 
"Well, who is it, sweetheart?" the man asked, taking a step closer with a wide grin on his face, "Were they pushy and forced themselves on you? Don't worry, I'm a true gentleman, and I won't let them harass you any longer! I'll let you set the pace, so you don't have to worry! I-"
"Izuku," Endeavor's voice was stern as he ran up to the young man. "We're ready to start burning."
But the way he said it, it didn't sound like he was warning the young man. It wasn't letting him know about their plan of action.
The young man looked up at him and nodded. "Go ahead."
"Understood," and Endeavor dipped his head, the kind that people gave their superiors, and turned to leave. Right before he did, he took his jacket off and chucked it at the young omega, "Don't catch a cold."
The young man caught it with a sigh, like this was a huge pain when most people would be fighting for a whiff of an alpha of Endeavor's capability. Taking his backpack off against, he pulled the jacket on, and the man understood.
"Oh," he said. Pointing at Endeavor and then back, "You're... being courted by Endeavor?"
Izuku didn't respond, and Hawks dropped down next to him. Grabbing his backpack, he looked next to him.
"You get any water yet?" he asked, "Let's take a break together."
The young man looked up and gave a soft sigh, "The building-"
"Is secure."
"And the parking lot-"
"We're picking our favorites."
A smile graced his lips, and he nodded, "Where the bodies are burning."
"You really know how to pick a date venue," the blond said, but his arm was around Deku and his eyes was narrowed against the stranger. 
Izuku's elbow dug into his elbow, but he didn't say anything else. 
"You have... both of them? Courting you?"
And Izuku left with Hawks.

-

"So why haven't you chosen a mate?"
Izuku thought really hard about it. This had to be the longest time he had ever gone without getting asked that question. It had been a full 30 hours since the last time he heard it. A new record, in grisly times. Someone, somewhere, should celebrate.
"Is it... because they're lacking?"
"They're not," Izuku said before he knew what he was saying, "In the slightest, lacking. In any way."
The stranger frowned, like this was an easy puzzle with one definite answer instead of an amalgamation of people with varying opinions, emotions, and states of being. But, what would Izuku know? He was just a silly omega. 
"Well, if you're looking for someone a little less impressive and more down to earth-"
And Izuku easily drowned out the rest of the conversation. With the decline of vitamin supplements and the likes, he knew it was time to start hitting the trucks on the bridges a bit further out on the highway. It would have to be a one-and-done, and he could only hope that the weather hadn't ruined the supplies. His nose twitched, and when he rounded the corner, Dabi was there.
"Izuku," Dabi greeted, not even looking at the man behind him. He tilted his head, a small hum accompanying his little smile as his fingers reached for his hand. "We're done with two of the trucks. We should be ready to go for tomorrow morning."
Izuku tensed, still unused to the contact of someone who didn't want to hurt him, but he didn't fight it.
Dabi definitely noticed, but he didn't let go. His hand remained, a firm grip with his rough hands. Izuku, no matter how hard he tried, felt his heart pick up and his body relax. The opposing feelings conflicted, but he was starting to get used to it.
"So, what? You're just leading them on?"
And before Izuku could feel insulted, Dabi took a step forward. His hand shot out and grabbed the man by the neck. He choked, and then started to flail about. Dabi's hand started to smoke, eyes narrowed, and Deku wondered if it was easy to manage different temperatures for his hands. The hand holding his wasn't even sweating. He squeezed once.
"You're cleaning up the mess," Izuku informed.
"Well, can't have that," Dabi said, dropping the man on the ground. Eyes a frigid blue looked down at him, "You're lucky that there's a witness here I can't hurt."
And with that, he tugged Izuku behind him.

-

"Before, you would have just left," Dabi mentioned casually. "You would have suddenly, just stopped talking to us and it would have driven me crazy."
Izuku didn't reply.
Dabi gave a long sigh, "Fuck, I hate this," he said. Squeezing Izuku's hand, he marched onwards.
"Then let go."
Dabi stopped and pulled Izuku's hand so that he would remain behind him. With his face turned away, Izuku had no idea what kind of expression he was making. 
"Not about this," he said, "but that other thing."
"Speak clearly."
"Hope."
Dabi finally turned around, his expression scrunching up like he smelled something foul.
"It makes me feel like shit," he said, his other hand coming to his heart, "when I think that I have a chance with you."

~20 years since the end of the world?
deku's an omega from some omega house. when the world ended, he finally saw the blue skies.
determined to see the world

"How come no one's mated him? Is there like, something wrong with him?"
Enji narrowed his eyes, his lips set into a deep scowl, before he sighed. 
"He hasn't chosen me," Enji replied, "and I'm not some lesser alpha that can't earn my place."
Hawks' eyes fell to his hands, where several scars dotted his hands and wrist. He raised his eyes, and Enji looked down at his hands.
"Shameful, isn't it?" he said quietly, "I almost lost my reason several times."
Hawks, at the moment, didn't think that it was that big of a deal. He's had omegas before, and he never mated any of them. 
Well, he supposed he could help the big guy out. It looked like Enji treasured this omega dearly.
Hawks couldn't wait to see what kind of person she was.

-

"Oh my god," Hawks said quietly.
"Silence," Enji tried.
Hawks made a motion, "What the fuck?" he said, and then motioned at himself, "what the fuck?"
"Hawks-"
"Shit," the blond ran his hand through his hair, "He's so strong!"

-

"The alpha that goes around the world," Deku said, "That's the alpha I'll mate with."
Twice stared at him, "That... That's it?"
Deku nodded. "Yeah, I think I'll be okay after that."
The blond crouched down in front of him.
"I... I just wanna be with you," he said. "So, that means, it could be me, right? I could-could be yours?"
the young man stared up at him and smiled, gentle and beautiful in a way that Twice didn't want to wake up without it anymore.

-

"You really think that," and Fatgum pointed at Dabi before he continued, "that garbage can wouldn't try to take someone else's mated omega?"
Dabi frowned, but didn't refute the fact.
"Oh god," Yamada said, head in his hands, "what should we do?"
"We could kill him," Snipe said, in all seriousness. "One less guy to worry about."
"Are... were you really training to be a hero?"
"That was then, this is now."
Present Mic nodded, "...But you know, I don't think I could either."
Snipe frowned at him. "Could what? Kill Dabi? Leave it to me." He waved his gun for good measure.
"You would think I'm not in the room or something," Dabi deadpanned.
"No, I mean," Yamada ran his hand through his hair. "I don't think I'd stop either," he admitted.
There was a pause.
"Shit," Snipe said, lowering his gun.
"Well then, gentlemen of the fellow Trash Association," Dabi said, an arm on either one of them as he grinned, "I'm glad we cleared that up quickly, hm?"

# badly written fanfic

Because there was something that the original Midoriya would have never done. He stared at them and smiled.
"My name is Deku," he said. "Please, just call me Deku."

-

Who? Deku wanted to scream. Who would kill of such a beautiful person?

-

"This is a story!" Midoriya shouted back, "This is a story don't you-"
"If this is a story!" Shigaraki snapped back, just as loud, "If this really is a story then what's wrong with trying to get a happy ending!"
"This isn't your happy ending!"
"No!" Shigaraki shouted back, "You are."
