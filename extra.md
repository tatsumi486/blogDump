"Sorry for being so late," Natsuo and Touya came running up.
Midoriya, with a large bandage across his chin, shook his head.
"It's okay, I just got here," he explained. 

-

"So, what are you going to do with it?" Natsuo asked, motioning to the gem in Midoriya's hand.
"Oh, I'm a Supporter," Midoriya replied.
Natsuo, caught off guard by the sudden introduction, nodded his head numbly instead. 
"Yes? I know?"
And now Midoriya was looking at him like he was the one asking the funny questions.
"He's a Supporter," Touya repeated, 0% helpful. And then, eyebrows creasing, tilted his head, "Ah, well, Natsuo-kun's been out of the scene for a bit." He stared at Natsuo, "You know how any magic-class can use gems to channel their magic better?" he asked.
"Oh, like magic tools?" Natsuo asked, patting his shield, "Even I have a few."
Midoriya, eyes on the shield, looked unimpressed.
Touya chuckled, "Well you see, Midoriya here is the best Supporter," he said. Wrapping his arm around Midoriya, who was already starting to blush, he pointed at Natsuo, "and knows how to enhance."
Natsuo blinked. "Enhance?"
"Yeah," Midoriya nodded, "that's how support magic works."
Natsuo, jaw loosening, suddenly remembered the gemstone Touya carried like a touchstone. "Oh," he pointed at his brother, "Oh! You sleep well!"
"See?" Touya told Midoriya, all but burying his head in his hair, "Told you Natsuo's a smart guy. He just needed a reminder."
"Wow," Midoriya said, breathless and almost silently.
"No, no," Natsuo shook his head, "I'm the one that should say that. There's not a lot of people that can enhance anything! And you can just..." 
Midoriya nodded. "Regular buff spells are enhancers too," he said kindly, "So it's not that-"
"Niichan never lets that gem go," he said, "I didn't even realize that he wasn't sleeping well until I can see it. It's been like, weeks now. Your magic, your enhance, lasted weeks outside of a Gate. That's.... If that isn't awesome, I don't think I can handle what is."
And these days, when Midoriya spoke like that, a bubbling kind of rage started to build up in Natsuo's heart. The kind that only burned relentlessly under his skin, waiting for the right target to lash at.
"It's amazing," he spoke certainly. "Anyone else who says otherwise is horseshit."
Touya snorted, but pulled away from Midoriya. "What do you think about Natsuo's shield, by the way?"
"It's... uhm," Midoriya looked at the shield, then at Natsuo, hesitated, and looked back down.
"It's fine. I know it's not great," Natsuo said, "It's just a temporary until I can get a better one."
"That won't be hard," the young man said, his eyes tracing the shield, "To find a better one, I mean. It'll be really easy. I think most rocks can do better than this."
Natsuo felt his eyebrows rise. And, licking his lips, bit the bullet.
"Do you mind?" he asked, "nothing big and fancy since I'll be replacing it soon, but a small one? I just... I really like watching you cast magic."
If Midoriya got any redder, they would need a healer for him.
"O-Oh," he said, "I uh... I can do that for you."
And Natsuo pretended that he couldn't see Touya stick his chest out with a wide, toothy grin. There were more important things for him to focus on now anyways. 
Midoriya placed his hand on the shield.
"Some basic defensive runes should be good. And maybe an anti-erosion spell." The magic swirled around Midoriya's arm, before condensing right at his fingertips. The soft glow rested against his shield, shining it and polishing it brighter than what it was before. 
"Uh, Midoriya, this isn't a little spell," Natsuo said, breathless as he watched.
"when I was... thinking that you would be protecting us," Midoriya gave a little shrug, "I couldn't help it."
His heart raced in his chest, for reasons different than awe. 
"Oh," he said.
"Yeah," Touya said, wrapping his arm around his shoulder, "Oh."
Blue eyes were sharp, for just a second, like Natsuo did something he wasn't supposed to. Like back when they were kids and Natsuo followed Touya even when he was told to go away. 
He stared back. If Touya wanted to protect this, then he should work a little harder. Nothing worthwhile in life ever came easy, and all that.

-

"A C-rank?" Midoriya's eyes were wide and bright. There was nothing about his expression that denoting any bits of nervousness.
"Yeah, we managed to get dibs on it," Touya said, "You wanna go?"
The green-haired man shot up in his seat, "Yes!"
It was, obviously, unheard of for a C-rank Gate to be cleared with a party of three, A-Ranks or not. The fact that they were given this permit meant that someone really wanted them to die. He didn't think it would be their dad, since Natsuo didn't think that Enji would even notice if they were dead or alive. Maybe if they got too big, because it would make it harder for Shouto to shine.
As always, just thinking about the youngest-father pair made a frown twist on his face.
"Ah... Natsuo-san, you don't want to?"
Natsuo jolted out of his thoughts, and guilt started to worm into his heart when he saw the way Midoriya deflated.
"No, sorry, I lost track of my thoughts," he said, shaking his head. "C-rank, right? Let's go for it."
Touya gave him this look, which was surprising because Natsuo thought it would have been straight contempt for being a wet blanket. He didn't really know how to explain it, and Touya squeezed his shoulder.
"The people that notice when you're gone are right in front of you," he said. He turned back to Midoriya, a smile already stretching on his face, "Let's head out the day after tomorrow. Do you need to prepare anything in advance?"
The young man shook his head, curls bouncing with how hard he shook his head.
Touya gave an exaggerated sigh and shrug. 
"Nat-chan and I need to get new gloves. I need shoulder supports and he needs stuff for his legs. You wanna come with us?"
"A-Are you sure?"
"Yeah," Natsuo said, because there were only two people in the world that would notice when he died. "It'd mean a lot to me if you could give your opinon on enchantments and stuff. You're really good at that stuff."
Midoriya's cheeks turned a little pink. His eyes fell to the ground as he smiled shyly.
"Then, I'd love to come along. Thank you for inviting me."
Touya reached out to ruffle Natsuo's hair wildly before he left without another word.
Natsuo scowled, but he didn't mind. 
There were only two people that he would notice if they died, too.

-

"We're a party of three," Touya said. "As in, there are three of us."
Midoriya nodded. "You, me, and Natsuo."
Touya let out a short sigh of relief, at the very least, he didn't have to explain this part. Next to him, Natsuo gave him a dirty look. 
"What do you think about adding another person to our party?" Touya asked. 
"Like another frontliner?" Midoriya asked. "I think it'll be nice to have another person at the front. It'll help with your charge time and take the strain off of Natuso and my gems."
Natsuo, who had to have an hour long explanation on why their gate-clear time was so long, dropped his gaze in shame. He didn't even think about adding another member to their group. Of course, part of it was because he was comfortable and happy with just the three of them. Adding another person felt like it would ruin their hard-obtained balance.
Midoriya tilted his head, "did you have someone in mind?"
"Nope," Touya replied. "I didn't know if you liked big parties or not. If you didn't want anyone, then there would be no point in inviting anyone in."
Which, by the way, was not even close to the threats that he threw at Natsuo when Natsuo refused. No one would know or care, but Natsuo did. 
"But would anyone even want to party with us?" Midoriya asked.
"Oh yeah," Touya said, "They will."
"Like who?"
"Like anyone who has bills to pay, mouths to feed, or are looking to climb up the ranks."
"Yeah, we're pretty popular," Natsuo said.
"We are?"
"Yeah, we were trending yesterday."
"We were? But we weren't swimming."
There was a brief pause. The brothes exchanged a quick glance before 
"Midoriya, where's your phone?" Touya asked.
"Oh, it's right here! I found it, so I made sure to bring it today!"
Was this the moment? Natsuo couldn't help but wonder. Were they finally going to exchange numbers? Almost three months since they started jumping Gates, they were finally going to exchange numbers?
Midoriya pulled out a phone. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that he pulled out half a phone. The numpad part of a flip phone sat innocently on the table when Midoriya pulled it out of his pocket.
Natsuo had seen Midoriya perform straight miracles in dungeons. He had been under his magic, a kind of magic that inspired confidence and protection. He's seen Midoriya repair lost arms and half-eaten Hunters back to their original health with nothing more than a wave of his hand. 
And that Midoriya, who smiled at the ground when someone complimented him, beamed at his party members as he showed his sad excuse of a phone.
"Ta-da," he said, bursting at the seams. 
Natsuo looked at it. Something nice. There had to be something kind about this that he could spin. There has to be a way to say something nice-
"Does it even work?" Touya asked, "To be honest, I haven't had a chance to get a phone for myself."
That's right, Natsuo remembered getting Touya's old brick-of-a-phone to him when he woke up. The doctors mentioned that it would be good for him to have something familiar, but now that he was using his head, he was beginning to think that it did the opposite of help. 
"Let's get new phones," Touya said, "Matching ones, but different colors."
"Aren't phones expensive?" Midoriya asked, like he doesn't go through gemstones like popcorn.
"Hm, should we go to another Gate this week?"
At the prospect of another Gate, he straightened. Eyes shining like stars, he nodded eagerly. 
Touya's expression melted just a little bit, and Natsuo wondered if this was what he was going for. 

-

"...You live where?"
"In the apartments..." Midoriya trailed off and pointed, "Over there."


-

"Natsuo, what about your dreams? You don't have to be a hunter! You can be whatever you want! You don't have to give up on your studies!"
"...Did your students say something?" Natsuo asked.
"What? why?" Fuyumi asked, her eyebrows furrowing in her confusion.
"I couldn't think of any other reason why you would suddenly care," her brother replied. He took in her hurt expression, and sighed. He just didn't have the energy to deal with this anymore. All they did was fight. And unlike being in a gate, it wasn't the good kind of fight.
Grabbing his bag, he shrugged.
"Fuyumi, you know, I've always hated dad. I always hated dad, and when I grew up, I realized that I hated mom too. I hated them, but avoiding them was easy." He shrugged, and met her eyes. "But you know, I don't want to hate them. It's exhausting. So it's better to be strangers. It's not like you even knew what I was studying for."
And with the last of his stuff, he left the Todoroki Estate. This time, he hoped forever. 

-

"Dabi, what's that?"
The three stopped in the middle of the street. Ignoring the dirty looks that the other pedestrians gave them as they were forced to change their route. 
"Uh..." Dabi stared at what Midoriya pointed at and then shrugged. "Natsuo, what is that?"
Natsuo, pulling his phone out and googling it, answered with a prompt, "It's a new store. They well lingerage."
Touya straightened, and gave Midoriya a toothy grin, "Sounds like our kind of place."
Midoriya's eyes trailed from Touya's chest to Natsuo's, his face turning into a progressively darker color of red as he shook his head.
"G-gate, we should do to the gate."
Touya's chortling laughter rang loudly, alarming several civilians around them.
"Hey, isn't that..."
"Oops," Touya turned away, "Better get going."
"You're the one that blew our cover," Natsuo hissed back.

-

"Midoriya, what about Spain?" 
"Spain?"
"Or really any of these European countries," Touya added, "At least we can get married there."
The following day, legislation passed and gay marriage was allowed. Touya, clutching his sides as he shook with laughter, gave Midoriya a sloppy kiss to his cheek.
"You wanna have our honeymoon on a beach? The Caribbeans are beautiful this time of year."
Midoriya playfully pushed back. 
"I don't really care as long as we're together."
The bitter energy, the angry comments, the petty attributes, all faded away in that second. It left nothing except for the gentle smile on Dabi's lips. A little slower and intimate, he kissed Midoriya's temple, then his cheek, and placed his forehead against Midoriya's. Eyes closed, he gave a small hum.
"We can do that."

### gacha

"I don't... I don't understand," Midoriya said, looking at the pamphlet and then back up. "It said 805 drop. It said..."
"We ran this exactly 100 times," Shigaraki said. "And I guess we'll be running it 100 times more."
"No," Midoriya said quietly, his voice just barely a whisper. "No, I don't want to spend my days like this."


### Way Back Home

"Why don't you ask Chiyo-san?"
"...Who?"
Todoroki furrowed his eyebrows, "Chiyo-san," he replied. "Midoriya stocks candy for her every once in a while."
The blond blinked back, "He what?"
"You didn't know?" Todoroki frowned back. 
"Okay, okay before we get into our trust-issues and insecurities," Sero spoke up, lifting his hand up, "Where is it? Let's just head over."
"I don't get it," Mineta said, "He has a phone. What's the point of his phone if he's not going to ever use it?"
"Mineta, you're just jealous that no one wants your number."
"Alright then," Bakugo snapped out, "lead us there."


### Rotting Flower

"Don't kill him!"
Snipe jerked in response. The [order] had bound his entire body for a second. With a frustrated sigh, he took a step back. Lifting his gun, he shot him in the thigh to make sure he wouldn't run. He screamed, the sound bouncing around the room, as he curled around the wound.
"Do we really need to keep him alive?" he asked his Master.
Midoriya nodded, "If we kll him, all his slaves die with him."
Snipe paused, and turned back to Midoriya. He gave a quiet chuckle. He wondered how anyone could ever say that Midoriya was a cold person? De-materializing his gun, he took a step back.
"Sensei," Midoriya called out, "Take care of the rest."
Around Midoriya, a black smoke curled around him. The sight of it, and the feel of that malicious energy, had Snipe recoiling. 
"Step back," Midoriya warned him. 

### Pansy

Alone, Shennong thought, he was okay being alone. He thought and believed it, until that hand slid into his, and with a wide grin on her face, tugged him along to view the starry skies from the flower field. He should have been okay, being alone.
Wrapping an arm around her, his human, he rubbed his face alongside her. She giggled, a bright sound that he could encase in his heart so he would be reminded of a time when he wasn't alone.
