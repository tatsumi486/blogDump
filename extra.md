"You want to be free, right?" Midoriya asked, eyes gentle. "It's alright. I don't blame you."
He looked at the assailant, he looked young.
Death by stabbing. It wasn't the worst way to go, and all things considered, this was probably bettter. 
"Get out of here quickly," he said. "Or else you will face a life worse than death."
"Why... Why are you letting me go?"
"When we're hurt, we hurt others. It's alright. I don't blame you. So run away and forget all of this.

Shigaraki had ten fingers.
He didn't use to. Which was funny. Since he always ragged on people for being useless and not pulling their weight, and all of that. but when it really came down to it, he was about as useful as a baby. Consumed a lot of supplies for absolutely nothing in return. As much as he wanted to claim that it wasn't really his fault, since it wasn't like he had the hands to help with, he knew the truth.
He didn't want to live. He didn't want to die. The ultimate state of laziness, where he wouldn't try to survive but he wouldn't actively look for death either. 
Supposedly, at the end of the world, people were supposed to come together and fight. Deadweight were just bodies waiting to die. Shigaraki, who had been a part of three separate groups (and caused the demoition of four), saw this as a certainty. It just wasn't feasible, to think that anyone would be able to do that for anyone. In majority of the places he's seen, even children and eldery were expected to work if they wanted to eat. 
People could not survive on their own. They were weak like that. Confronted with monsters, it became even more apparent how lacking they were. the people that Shigaraki used to think of as invincible fell apart like ash.
The world that Sensei wanted, filled with excitement and The Strong, turned out to be a world where he didn't belong.
Weak, weak, weak. Monsters hung on the horizon and everyone was just weak. Humanity was just biding their time to die. 
And Shigaraki was certain that this was his reality.
Missing seven fingers and half his hand, Shigaraki leaned against the concrete wall. Lost in a residental neighborhood he's never seen before, he watched former civilians and monsters shuffle and crawl towards him. And at that time, he figured he'd die without being anyone. Even if he wanted to fight it, what could he do?
While contemplating nothing, a man in a helmet came down the street. Armed with just a bat, Shigaraki was forced to confront a new reality.

Shigaraki yawned. Dreaming abut the past always made him feel even more tired. He scratched the back of his neck, a habit he never broke out of, and shuffled out of his shitty sleeping bag. 
The moon poured in from above, a rare sight after all these days of constant snow. Well, it wasn't like he was going to get anymore sleep. 
The third-floor prep lab was his. It was small, but he preferred it to being cramped in a classroom with some of the others.
To begin with, he didn't have many memories of school. It probably was from a time before Sensei, and honestly, if he didn't remember anything, it was probably because it wasn't worth remembering. 
He made his way to the sink, washed his face, and grabbed his jackets. Even with the heating on, it was still too cold.
Which was funny. He could sleep without this jacket but his gun never left his side. If someone had stopped him three years ago, told him that he would trust weaponry over his quirk, he would have laughed in their face. 
He slid the door open, and his nose immediately crinkled. Someone had guts to come scenting the area around his territory. He crackled his knuckles. With how strung-up everyone had been getting, it was only a matter of time before something gave. A grin twisted onto his face at the thought that he would get to-
His thoughts stopped he heard someone's sharp cry. Without thinking much, he sprinted over.

An omega that smelled like blood would be the omega that Shigaraki couldn't stop staring at. 

### Way Back Home

["this isn't your world"]
Midoriya woke up, tears streaming from his eyes. He sat up, fingers coming up to his eyes and he took a deep breath.
Today too, he was in the wrong place.


"Well, whatever you want, I'm certain you'll get there," Miruko said, certain like the sun.
When Midoriya looked up at her, she grinned back down.
"Look, hard work pays off."
And somehow, being told that after the long hiking journey hit him differently.
His eyes welled with tears. His body was that pleasant kind of tired, where he worked it out just enough, and his heart felt calm. He sniffled as he looked over the horizon.
The world would look the exact same, but they would be incredibly different. The skyline with Miruko was one that he would probably never see again, not in his world where Miruko couldn't...
He looked out.
"Everyone..." his voice cracked, but he kept going, "says that. That I'll get everything that I want."
And his heart felt like it was going to fold in on itself and crumple, like a house made of cards. 
His hands trembled, because success meant goodbye.
These days, no matter how hard he berated himsef for stealing what wasn't his, the words began to rang hollow even in his own ears.

Gilgamesh stared down at her, and Gudako did her best to look anywhere but him. The dark look in his eyes, coupled with the bags under his eyes, contrasted the smile on his face as he leaned against her desk. Red eyes glowed for just a second as he took in her features.
"Mongrel," he said, voice so low that it felt criminal. 
"I don't know."
