### kingless + that floating island verse?

[Sakamata Kugo would like to swear his loyalty to you]
"Hit yes," Gang Orca said.
Midoriya looked at the screen and then back up at the man. He shook his head.
"B-but that means-"
Gang Orca, Sakamata, tilted his head as he leaned backwards with a lazy smile.
"Yep," he confirmed. "I think you have what it takes."
"Huh?"
"I want to see it. The world you make when you become King."


### the young king

A high-pitch scream echoed through the corridors, and the entirety of their small kingdom seemed to reverberate.
First to the room despite being half a building away, Hawks came crashing through the window while Dabi broke the doors down to the main bedchambers. Both of them met eyes briefly before their eyes swpet across the room, guards coming in behind Dabi to check on the situation.
And in a mess of blankets, someone tumbled off their king's bed. He was much smaller, almost the size of a child, and made these high-pitch noises. If he was an assassin, it would be an embaressement that some mess of a child had slipped through their guard detail. His shirt slid off his shoulder and the blankets created a knot around him. Eventually, his head popped out and all the guardsman in the room stared in shock at their baby-faced king sitting there.
"H-Has my room always been this big?" he asked, voice higher than they remembered.
"...All of you, get out," Dabi said to the guards, dismissing them swiftly as Hawks came in and kneeled next to their King, however young he looked.
"Hawks? Did you grow?"
"...Izuku, I need you to remain calm, but... I think you shrunk."
"S...Shrunk?"
"Sounds like he's at least aware," Dabi said, looking over the mess the desk was. An array of notes and magic circles, empty and half-full vials and open books were strewn around, "What's the last thing you remember?"
Midoriya placed his head into his hands and groaned. "Had dinner with Gang Orca. It was... It was a sea-monster. It tasted so good." His stomach growled.
"...Are you taking this seriously?" Hawks asked, just to be certain. 
Midoriya ignored him, "And then I... I came back and I had this idea for.. Oh!" he snapped his fingers and tried to get up. With the mess the blankets and his clothes made around him, it got tangled up and he almost pitched right back, face-first into the ground. Hawks caught him without a problem, and Dabi took a step forward as though he could have caught him in time. 
The young man flushed, and steadied himself, "T-Thanks," he said. 
The young man tugged at the blankets, and Hawks helped himself to unwrap him from the blanket, and when he was freed, realized that he was only in a large nightshirt. The shirt cut a few inches above his knees, catching Dabi's interest even more. Hawks, in the meantime, trailed his hands from his knees down to his ankles as he hummed approvingly.
"I -Let go," Midoriya said, lifting his leg and trying to shake himself out of Hawks' grip. It was easy enough, but the blond's heavy gaze stayed on him.
Ignoring him, or more pre-occupied with other things, Midoriya rushed to his notes.
"I was setting up a spell but I..." his hand came to his head, "Did I cast it? Oh, I think I was piling in some magic for the spell but I..." he looked around and picked up a gem. "It wasn't this big last night."
"I could be bigger," Dabi replied, standing right behind him. And Midoriya craned his head up, eyes wide and slowly he opened his mouth.
"Were... Were you always this tall?"
A deep purr came from the older man, his hands coming to his hips.
"Izuku, I don't think your spell worked the way you intended it to."
"Yeah, you think?" the young man snapped back, but he gave a sudden gasp.
"Something wrong?" Hawks asked, coming to the other side of the young man. He leaned against the table, and placed his hand on top of Midoriya's, and gave a warm smile to him.
"I..." he hesitated, his cheeks turning red and Dabi licked his lips. He stepped a little closer, and his hips grinded against the young man. "Oh," he said quietly.
"Oh?" Dabi replied. 
"Uhm," Midoriya's face flushed, "I wanna go wash up."
"We were worried about you," Hawks added.
"Midoriya!" a banging sound came on the door, destroying the mood. "Midoriya, are you okay?!"
Dabi's lips twisted into a scowl and Hawks frowned. Midoriya breathed a small sigh of relief.
"Yamada," he sighed. "Yamada, can you call Best Jeanist!?"
He forced Dabi away, who grunted and didn't bother hiding the tent in his pants, and Hawks gave this long, mournful sigh as his eyes remained on Midoriya's thighs.
"Yeah sure, is everything okay?"
"Yeah, bad spell. I'm little."
The door slammed open, and Midoriya wished that he wasn't a King in name and people actually treated him with a litle more grace and respect.
Yamada gave an impressed whistle, eyeing him up and then down with a nod.
"Wow," he said.
"Right?" Dabi added.
"Please," Midoriya tried again, his hand coming to clutch at his long shirt as he bit down on his lip, "It's cold. I want to wear something."
"Nothing I can't fix for you, my dear," Hawks said, a wide grin on his face.
And Midoriya wondered if this was something that he would have to do himself.

-

After six hours and several passionate rounds of reaffirming vows, Midoriya finally got into some smaller clothes and managed to get to the dining room.
And by manage, he meant that Enji had him perched on his arm like a big bird, and Midoriya tried not to make any eye contact with anyone walking by. 
But it wasn't like Midoriya could tell Enji to put him down and let him be, the older man would wilt, he would pout, he would give Midoriya the softest gaze and hang his head, and Midoriya swallowed all of his embaressment.
And, he wouldn't be able to walk properly anyways. Or would take three times longer than if he allowed Enji to take him away.
"Are you uncomfortable?"
"No," Midoriya wasn't used to the sound of his own voice, but apparently, Dabi couldn't get enough of it. It felt scratchy and higher-pitch. Midoriya wondered if he would be okay.
