"...An axe?"

But the way Deku held it, an axe that was clearly made for someone bigger than him, it looked light. His eyes fell to Deku's thin arms and then back up to the young man's face.

"Can you use that?"

The young man stared back and gave him a tight smile.

"I hope I don't have to."

He ate his words shortly afterwards. He stared, mouth gaping open in his shock. A swing from that giant axe of his and a wave of water was shot out from the blades edge. It crashed into the pillars above, cutting through solid rock and concrete like butter. It came crashing down and Deku took a step back. holstering his axe over his shoulder and onto his back. 

"Let's keep going," he said as the destruction settled behind him. "It'll hold them off long enough for us to get through."

Bubaigawara pressed several kisses to the side of Midoriya's head, grinning when he caught the young man giggling. He leaned down further, mouthing kisses along his neck and relishing in the laughter that bubbled out of him.

"What's wrong?" Midoriya asked, a smile playing on his face. 

"Missed ya," the older man replied, pressing his face closer against his. "What do you want for dinner? Order something that'll keep Dabi out longer."

The young man laughed at that, "I thought you didn't mind him anymore."

"I don't," the blond agreed, "But that doesn't mean I want someone to intrude."

"Intrude?"

Bubaigawara stood up, pulling Midoriya down to lay down on his side, and climbed right over him. Eyes hooded, pupils dilating, his voice dropped a few octaves as he hovered over the young man.

"Yeah, intrude," he said, almost distractedly. His eyes seemed to fall to Midoriya's lips, and whatever he was thinking about, made his breathing grow labored and his pants tent out. "I uh..." he looked up from his lips to his eyes and then gulped, "Is that a yes?"

"Huh?"

"Babe, I'm so hard that it hurts," he purred out, "Can I have you? Here? Like this? I'll make you feel good."

"I know," Midoriya said, reaching up, "but you have to kiss me first."

Twice heart fluttered in his chest. What wouldn't he do?

Twice stared at the coin in front of him.

"Heads, I'm Jin," he said, "Tails, I'm Twice."

He flipped the coin, even though he already knew which one he wanted to be.

-

"I... I what?" Midoriya was so cute when he stuttered.

Twice nodded his head, "The other guy," he said, pointing at his head, "Is really fucking quiet when you're here," he explained. "So it's even more obvious to me."

"...What is..?"

"You're really fucking cute."

Midoriya's face went scarlet, and it was quickly becoming one of Jin's favorite color.

"I'll be honest, I've never felt like this before," he said, "It's a little scary. When you get to my age, things that get you all turned around is scary." He looked up at Midoriya and took a step forward. "But when you're in front of me, I don't think it's so scary anymore."

>> twice vs jin, and Twice is quieter since he entered that dungeon, and gets louder for every day he's away

>> more time as Jin to be with deku and he's so in love
