"I think this is a new record for you," Chisaki said, "64 stitches."
Midoriya arched an eyebrow at him.
"Is that a challenge?"
The older man snorted. "It was not. Please, I'm not made of time."
A quiet huff escaped from between Midoriya's lips, and Chisaki stared at him for a moment longer. 
"What happened?" he asked.
Midoriya shrugged back, and Chisaki watched as he didn't flinch even when the motion pulled on his stitches. 
"I'm sure you won't listen to me if I tell you to take a break for at least two days," the former yakuza said, eyeing the way Midoriya was strapping his knife to his belt.
"Good, that'll make this faster."
"But I want to elongate every moment that I spend with you."
Midoriya's fingers paused, and he raised his eyes to meet a pair of eyes, warm like dandelions under the spring sun. There was a phrase, a word, to describe the way that Chisaki looked at him, in these moments where Midoriya and he stopped being patient and doctor.
"What should I do to catch your interest? I thought I was smart enough to figure it out," the man said, leaning against the counter. His words formed a spell of loss, but he remained as handsome as he laid waste to his pride, "But I'm at my wits end. If I lay myself bare to you, will you see my earnest plea? Midoriya, I-"
"Don't say it!"
The silence betweenthem was deafening. Like the silence that followed a gunshot, they stood in a petrified kind of silence for a moment. 
Chisaki's jaw clenched tightly as the words sank into his heart. The only pair of fangs that would ever pierce his heart would be from the person that made it worth living.
"If you say it, we can't go back," Midoriya spoke quietly. His eyes furrowed as he shook his head. "I won't ask anything of you, so don't say anything you're going to regret."
Which was the exact opposite of what Chisaki wanted to hear.
"Don't run," Chisaki called out, "Don't make a coward of you and me."
"Then what am I supposed to do?"
"Nothing," Chisaki replied. "It's nothing that requires your action. Not like that. You don't owe me an answer. You don't have to do anything to me, or for me. But don't pretend that it didn't happen. Take me seriously. That's all I want."
To exist, Midoriya was smart so he probably could fill in the blanks like that. He knew, everyone knew, that Chisaki didn't come from a beautiful background and a peaceful life. Chisaki fell under the people that had never experienced peace until the world ended. The thing that mattered to Chisaki the most was the proof that he existed. 
And he wanted Midoriya to be that proof. So long as Midoriya recognized it, recognized Chisaki, that was enough. That would be proof, for him, that he ever lived.
"That's not fair," Midoriya whispered.
"No," Chisaki shook his head, 'It's not." Still, he was smiling, because Midoriya was as calously kind as he was gently cruel. "Thank you. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to fall in love with you."
Midoriya stared at him, shock and disbelief painting his face before it turned into something painful, as though Midoriya was stabbed instead of being confessed to. Without another word, he rushed out of the room. 
Chisaki rubbed his face. 

-

When night began to crawl across the skyline, Midoriya came back.
"Chisaki. Come with me."
And when asked so politely, how could Chisaki ever refuse?
Abandoning everything, he followed Midoriya out the makeshift infirmary, and then out of the main school building. When it looked like they were going to leave the school-ground. Chisaki spoke up.
"Not that I wouldn't follow you anywhere, but shouldn't I be equipped?"
"Then don't come with me."
His eyebrow twitched, and a little more cautiously of what was around them, followed. If this was Midoriya's way of testing him, of testing his feelings by demanding complete obediance, then Chisaki should meet in full. If Midoriya didn't recognize his feelings, he wouldn't exist, after all.
If Midoriya told him to die, it would be a beautiful death. If Midoriya was the one who killed him, it would be even better. 
"...Not at all," he said, "Lead the way."
And Midoriya, who always looked so certain and moved so confidently, hesitated. He turned back to lead them out.
Without knowing where he was going to go, and without being somewhat close to each other, it would be awkward to stand next to him. However, with Midoriya in front of him, his eyes continued to trail and wonder about what wasn't his. Briefly, he was jealous of the patrol group that got to follow Midoriya out. His eyes traced his back muscles, the way they rippled under taut skin, framed by boney structures, and between one second and another, Midoriya stopped.
"Stay back," Midoriya said, "And watch me."
Green eyes, too bright and too vibrant to fit in metal frams and broken drywall, stole Chisaki's breath away.
"Understood."
Midoriya stepped into the broken frame, and launched himself into the street down below. Chisaki watched, as the shadows beneath broke and scurried at the arrival of their resident brawler. Under the moonlight, Chisaki got to watch the bloodbath smear across the the floor and walls of the street. Closer to the back, some monsters were sniped down, and he understood that the regular patrol group had probably caught up by now.
Still, Chisaki's gaze always returned to Midoriya. He watched as Midoriya gave a kick, his shin coming into contact with a head and it exploded out. Using that momentum, he jumped into the air, spinning around to do a backwards roundhouse kick with his other leg. Landing into a puddle of blood, he slipped onto his hands and pushed off into a flip. Landing onto the next victim, his elbow came swining at a head. The front two inchers of it splattered out, and he plunged his fist into the remains of the head. He leaned forward, tipping the weight over, and as soon as he got to his feet, swung the body to hit the other monsters in vinicty. With a little more than a foot in all direction cleared out, Chisaki could see with glaring clarity how bright his eyes were.
Standing there, for a few moments that stretched into half an hour before it was just Midoriya drenched in blood, standing alone under the moonlight.
He raised his hand at Chisaki, a motion to come down. 
Without any hesitation, Chisaki overhaul'd the side of the building to do just that.

-

"Well?"
"Well what?"
"Have you changed your mind?"
Overhaul's eyes narrowed. Did Midoriya really think that he would change his mind that easily? Just for that? Did he think that he was the same as all those righteous people here? The thing about people who lived as bottom-fodders was that they never had a choice from the start. Those who can't make a choice and go through with them wouldn't make it very far. 
"I didn't see a reason to."
"Then you're disillusioned. I thought you hated filthy things."
To punctuate his words, he lifted his hand up to Chisaki. 
"Yes," Chisaki agreed, "I do." Still, he didn't shy from Midoriya, and instead took a step forward. He hated filthy things, definately. He understood what Midoriya wanted to do, what he was trying to do. "But in this filthy world," he said, boldly taking Midoriya's bloodstained hands into his. The blood was slick and cold, but Chisaki relished the thought that someone wasn't pulling away from his touch, "I found something truly beautiful."
He pulled Midoriya's hands to his chest, where his pulse thundered in his chest as Midoriya came so close. Blood smeared across his shirt and jacket, the most innocent feeling Chisaki had ever felt bloomed undernearth the lunar sky.
"Or rather, you found me."
The shade of green that had completly redefined his life, from the time he woke up to the way he treats the people around him, stared back at him. Clean. Pristine. Beautiful.
He grinned, finally feelikg like he understood what Oyaji meant, all those years ago.

-

"What... just happened?"
Chimera narrowed his eyes as them, a furious scowl on his lips as he moved his rifle over his shoulders. 
"Romance," he hissed.

<->

A thud resounded. And then another. It echoed and another slam hit. With every slam, Midoriya felt his head throb, as though they were hammering on his head instead of the door. He spat a mouthful of blood on the ground, coughing miserably as his hand came down to the open wound on his side. 
What a mess.
He tried to pull up onto his knees, but he couldn't get his body to listen to him. Wheezing, feeling as though his ribcage was collasping in on itself, he tried to summon the strength to get up. If he could get up, then he could fight. And if he can fight, he would win. He wasn't going to lay here and just accept-
"Izuku!"
Fuck.
His desperate wriggling to survive ramped up a little, even as his energy seeped out like his blood. 
"Shit, oh shit, Izuku?"

Aizawa's hand came to his head. He pushed his hair back and leaned in to kiss him fully on the lips. It was chaste, a press of warm lips before he pulled back. His eyebrow smoothed out, a rare look of serenity crossing that dirty face.
"I love you, Izuku," he said, before he punched Midoriya in the stomach, right above where the open wound gushed. 
No, no. Midoriya said. Because this always happened.
People who said they loved him always left him. 
He didn't want this. He didn't want this. His fuzzy vision darkened further, and if he closed his eyes, the last thing he would see would be that merciful expression from a needlessly vicious man.
Against best judgement, his eyes closed.

-

A metal door came crashing down from the ceiling, landing right over the monster's head like a moment from a silly cartoon. Aizawa's eyes stared, just long enough to register that this monster wasn't going to be an immediate threat, so he turned back to the fight. 
When the fight was over, and Aizawa had a new dislocated shoulder and broke his arm in two parts, he turned back to the equally exhausted looking Midoriya.
"You-"
"-What does it mean?" Midoriya cut him off, and wasn't that a first, "to love someone? Is it the person you happen to see right before you die?"
Aizawa stared back.
"It was purely selfish," the older man said, "that's it. I wanted to make one more memory before I died."
The pump of adrenaline slowly died out, and it left behind the staggering weight of his guilt. The word that he held back for so long managed to finally unhinge in his chest and escape his lips.
"And, I wanted you to know that you are loved."
"Is that your love? The willingness to die in a useless and avoidable manner? Then, was I supposed to feel happy that someone who loved me wanted to die?"
"Since I didn't die, and it's all aired out anyways," Aizawa replied back, "I'll prove it to you, bit by bit, everyday that I'm alive."
Aizawa's tired slouch straightened, although he favored one side a little bit, as his earnest gaze met Midoriya's.
"I love you, Izuku. Sorry that this was the circumstances I told you in. Let's talk about this when we get back."
"Don't bother," Midoriya replied back, eyes cold. "Since you didn't die."

-

It didn't feel like their relationship changed. Which didn't say much, because Midoriya rarely spent any time with him to begin with. But there were moments, right when their eyes met, and maybe it was the way the sunset filtered through the windows, it looked like Midoryia blushed.
It made his heart leap into his throat, even if his expression didn't change.
"Izuku, the inventory update," he said, waving the report in his hand. 
But today was different.
He reached into his pocket and pulled out another slip of paper and handed it to Midoriya. The young man furrowed his eyebrows, probably wondering what it was. He let him take it, watched eyes skim over it and managed a smile when green eyes landed on him.
"This-"
"Traditionally," Aizawa cut in, "I would give this to your parents and have them agree. And then, I would officially try to court you, Obviously, things are different now, but I understand the thought-process behind such archaic ways. Naturally, I don't need an answer right now." He placed both hands on the desk and leaned in closer to Midoriya's face, just until their noses almost touched. "I want to spend the rest of my life with you," he said, voice quiet like the dying twilight, "And I want you to view me as a suitable mate. Does that make my intention clear?"
He leaned back, breaking the spell that froze their moment. He gave a coy little smile, eyes bright in a way that Midoriya hadn't ever seen before.
"Look forward to it. I'll keep my eye on you."
With a lazy wave over his shoulder, Aizawa walked out with a spring in his step. Left behind, face flushed darker than the amber skies, Midoriya stared at the Letter of Intention left in his hands. 

<->

There were a lot of things that Midoriya had to do today. They were going to clear out the parking garage of the strip mall, testing the roof of the houses, running checks on the water, things like that. Lots to do. He was going to finish with his lesson in Edo-era policies and head out. 
"Hey, be my mate."
Midoriya looked up at Shigaraki, really squinted at him, and then looked out the window. The sky is in fact, above the ground. A bright blue with small, wispy clouds floating on by. He looked back at Shigaraki.
"You don't mean that."
"Be my mate."
The shock quickly wore off as his Midoriya's eyes sharpened with his temper. If Shigaraki thought he could be intimidated, he had another thing-
"Please."
No, it would turn out that Shigaraki just didn't know how to ask.
"No," Midoriya said.
"..I'll ask again next year," the alpha said, "Because I don't think I'll change my mind in a year."
Green eyes closed as he took a long sigh.
"I don't even know where to begin with you," he said. "What does being a mate even mean to you?"
Shigaraki raised his eyebrow, "That we do eechi things."
"We can do eechi things without mating," Midoriya shot back. 
Both of Shigaraki's eyebrows hiked up his face, "Will we? Can we?" His eyes dropped to Midoriya's lips, darkening in color.
"If I did, would you drop this?"
He leaned back, when Shigaraki started to lean in too close. It seemed to break the older man out of his trance. 
"I don't know," he replied, turning around so that Midoriya was facing his back. "I've never wanted someone like this."


### shitty sololvl

"You're an S-Ranker," Touya said, four parts frustrated and one part desperate, "You can do anything you want. It would be a waste of resources and human life to try and make you do anything, so you don't have to listen to anyone. Just do what you want to do!"
"...Any... anything?" Midoriya asked, his voice so quiet that it sounded like it would blow away like a candle.
Touya's shoulder slumped as he nodded. "Yeah. Anything."
"Like... eating chocolate before breakfast?"
Touya stared at Midoriya for a long moment. He fell back into his seat, placed his head in hands and took a long, suffered sigh.
"Yeah," he said, pulling his head up to stare at Midoriya, just as exasperated and tired, "like eating chocolate before breakfast."
"Wow..." Midoriya covered his mouth with his hands, a thousand stars in his eyes. "That's... really powerful."
Touya gave him a weak smile in return. 
"We'll start here," he sighed. 

### Returning a Gift

The way that Midoriya loved heroes, he loved villains. They were two sides of the same coin. Heroes were made even cooler and and stronger and even-more amazing because of the villains that they used as stepping stones to get where they were. Now that he was older, he understood that it was a cruel sentiment, but at the same time...
At the same time, he really respected villains. They really put everything on the line. It wasn't easy. There was nothing easy about choosing to go down a road with no other options. As pitiful as villains may seem, Midoriya respected that unwillingness to bend for anything and just move forward.
Being told that he was worthy of throwing away that resolve should have come as the greatest compliment. It should have, but these days, when he saw Chisaki's face, he felt guilt. Dabi, who used to call eating a waste of time, has favorite restaraunts that he drags Midoriya away from his work to go to. Shigaraki, who used to sneer and glare at the hero billboards, wiped down his figurines. Stain, who used to greet him with a knife to his neck, brought candy for him in his packets of information. 
While he knew that this was good for him, and so he shouldn't complain, it made him worry about the world at large. 
It worried him because the police gave him tip-offs. He had heroes reporting to him. Civilians were starting to turn to him instead of the proper authorities. 
In return for his future aspirations, it felt like he was selling his childhood.

### hawks & falcon

Hawks and Falcon were the apple of the public eye. He whistled at the double page spread on the magazine, the stretch of red feathers. Young and powerful, they were calm and great. Identical twins, they spelled out a long and hearty career in heroics...
Izuku placed the magazine down when his phone rang.
"Midoriya Izuku speaking-"
"We can't find Falcon or Hawks."
Izuku closed his eyes, "I understand," he told the frantic secretary, "I'll get right on it. I'm sure they'll turn up for lunch."
"Thank you so much, Izuku-kun! I knew I could count on you!"
These days, this has been gotten too habitual. As the phone call ended with a click, a hand came to take his phone out of his grip while another hand flattened his magazine on the table.
"C'mon, Izuku," Falcon purred against his ear as Hawks grabbed both his hands and placed them on the desk. 
He tried his best, but Midoriya shivered as teeth scraped by his ear. 
"Get right on it," Hawks added from in front of him, fingers rubbing circles on his wrists as he leaned across the desk.
"I'm on the clock," Izuku hissed back, pulling his hands away. "And so are you."
"Hero is-"
"-always working."
"C'mon baby bird," Falcon whispered as he tilted Midoriya's chin towards him. "Let's get lunch today."
Hawks, silent as a mouse, was already on the other side of him, feathers holding Midoriya's wrist down to the desk as he kissed his exposed neck.
"You haven't eaten anything, right?"
And just like that, they leaned back and away. 
"You left before I could get you your lunch." Hawks said, voice teasing but the gaze was anything but kind.
"Well, nothing to worry about, since we brought it, ne, Kei?"
"Good going, Gou. I was getting famished."
Agreeing to something that Midoriya couldn't hear, the two turned to him as one.
Hawks' hand came to wrench Izuku's chin from his twin's grip, leaning in to kiss his just as hungrily. Izuku pulled uselessly at his wrists, but couldn't get them free. Not that he ever did, but he never stopped trying. A hand came to tug at his necktie and undo his buttons. Falcon pushed his chair out from under him, and a pair of feathers kept him from falling. Eagerly taking the space behind him, Falcon buried his face in the crook of Izuku's neck.
Sometimes, Izuku really hated these twins.

### Housamo - Pansy

Alone, Shennong thought, he was okay being alone. He thought and believed it, until that hand slid into his, and with a wide grin on her face, tugged him along to view the starry skies from the flower field. He should have been okay, being alone.
Wrapping an arm around her, his human, he rubbed his face alongside her. She giggled, a bright sound that he could encase in his heart so he would be reminded of a time when he wasn't alone.
