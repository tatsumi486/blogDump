### kind nightmare

Recovery Girl's voice wasn't sharp. It was as gentle as it always was, but firm, reminding Midoriya that he was in the pressence of an adult, like he was just a kid who was caught tracking mud and he felt chastised. He dropped his gaze, gnawing on his lip, and Recovery Girl stared at him for another moment before repeating herself.
"...Midoriya-kun," she said, "I know when an injury is a result of violence."
He flinched like he had been burned, like he had been hit, whacked across the arm with a sharp branch or mauled by an axe, and jerked his head to nod.
Recovery Girl, who probably also understood how people acted when shown kindness, softened up.
"Midoriya-kun," she said quietly, "Is everything alright at home?"

"You should all have your liscenses revoked," Recovery Girl told them, voice cold and her gaze harsh. "How many of you

"...Do you remember?" Midoriya asked, "when I told you that ten of us awakened after the... the Aldera Incident?"
Natsuo stared back, and nodded slowly because he hadn't forgotten and the words still weighed heavy in his heart, and Midoriya nodded.
"I... I'm the only one," the young man said, his voice cracking and his eyes watering, "Of the ten of us who awakened on that day, I'm the only one that's still alive." He didn't cry, which was already a testament to Natsuo about how hard he must have held onto this.

Midoriya hummed as his steps stopped in the street. With four giant pieces of stone on the sides, he pointed at the otherwise empty lot, "This was where my favorite store was. It sold really popular Hunters in here, like All Might-san!" he said. "I used to have all of his figurines and his cards. I used to beg for an advance in my allowance so that I could do the gacha pulls! The store-keep, Otogawa-san," and he moved his arms and stretched his hands up above his head as though to show how big, "and he was this big! The nicest guy on the block, usually felt bad for me after the tenth pull and always just gave me the toy by the end of it."
"Hm," Touya hummed, "Looks like you've always had some bad luck, huh?"
Midoriya stilled, and then gave a watery laugh. "I guess so.
Natsuo frowned at his brother, feeling as though his words were too cruel, but Midoriya's eyes traced back to the empty area. He could imagine it, the same way he could remember with pristine clarity the amusement park he and his brother snuck off to see before. He couldn't remembered every second and every loop-de-loop, and he couldn't remember what that ride was called or what color it was. But he did remember that rush, the sound of his brother screaming next to him, with such exuberance that he understood.
When Midoriya looked off at that lot, it wasn't the cool gadgets and the cards that he was thinking about. 
He wondered if Touya, who lived inside of a gate, remembered, too.

-

"But uhm," he cleared his throat, "after the gate was cleared out, the active hunters in the area was slammed. People closed up and left. The people who didn't leave were the people who couldn't, either because they couldn't afford to or because they weren't able to."
Touya was silent, and shook his head. 
"Wait," Natsuo said, "I... I don't get it."
Touya's gaze was hard, but Midoriya's was gentle.
"When gates break open like that, and monsters come out, it introduces a lot of unrefined magic into the area."
"Yes," Natsuo knew that much. 
"People that don't have any magic, when exposedto a large amount of magic like that suddenly, they fall into Eternal Slumber."
"Oh," Touya said quietly, and Natsuo felt momentarily comforted by the fact that this wasn't common-knowledge, "but that hasn't been proven."
"It hasn't, but 20% of the entire population in a 50km radius fell into Eternal Slumber with a week after the gate-break," Midoriya replied, "5% awakened, and everyone else either ran away in time or died."
Natsuo remembered. No one had even noticed that there was a tiny gate inside an shed in the corner of the school that had been closed for repairs. It was a small gate, but the magic concentrate was stiffling. It was later estimated that it was a D-Rank that became some A-Rank Red Gate, but there would never be any confirmation. He knew because his dad was a part of the attack force that went to close the gate. 
"There's not a lot of places that hire 14 year olds," Midoriya continued, "but we still need to eat and sleep. We all got sent to the orphanage, but they couldn't deal with the sudden influx of kids that saw monsters eat their peers."
Natsuo felt his head ache.
"Luckily, I met the right people, and I managed to get my liscense. I tested high, but as a minor-"
"-You're automatically set as an E-rank, and you can't change that for five years."
Midoriya nodded. "E-Rankers don't make enough money to feed everyone. I can go into four E and D-rank dungeons a day but we still don't have money for everyone to get clothes. No money and too many bad memories, so the shops close," Midoriya's voice picked up speed, proving to them how long he had held on to these words. "Gates kept appearing, but there was no one outside to report them, so they kept breaking open. We wouldn't even realize that there was a gate there until we lost a building or someone didn't come home. And I can't-I can't heal anyone that doesn't have magic. It would send them into Eternal Sleep, even if it managed to fully heal them." he shook his head, as though to expel a particularly bad memory out of his head. He gave a deep sigh, and finished, "Before we knew it, we were living in a modern-day slum."
And Natsuo, who could just turn off his phone and sit in the library and have everything related to hunters disappear away, could not relate.

"I'm going to visit a friend," Midoriya explained, "We always take that time together so I can visit him at the detention center and let him know that his parents' graves are clean."
"I..." Natsuo blanched as the words started to sink into his head. "You what?"
Midoriya smiled back, a sheepish thing as he rubbed the back of his head."
Touya frowned. 
"So, what's he in for?"
"Quirk misuse," Midoriya replied, "Some kids got injured when he used his quirk."
"I see."
"He's one of the four of us that still lived after the Aldera incident," their supporter explained. "And of the guys who awakened, most of them died as soon as they tried to face the monkey-dogs. I was still in and out of conciousness, but Kacchan managed to keep everyone else alive. But he used his quirk to do so."
Natsuo thought about it, the complaints that came in for people to be allowed to use their quirks during gate-breaks and granted sanctions. But, too many people also took that opportunity to loot stores or commit crimes using their quirk to intimidate others, so it was stuck in legislation hell no matter how hard people protested. Natsuo remembered seeing them and wishing that they wouldn't protest on days he needed to get to class early for his presentaiton. 
"You don't sound upset," Natsuo said, "Do you... Don'tyou think that's wrong? He was literally just trying to stay alive."
Midoriya shook his head, "He's alive. There's no chance of a prison to ever face a gate-break."
The entire city of Mutsafuyu, Natsuo thought, filled with civilians who did the right thing and followed the rules and everything, was just written off as a tragedy. Or perhaps, because of the emergence of the Best Supporter in Hunter History, it was written as a "tragic but nessesary thing."
It made Natsuo nauseous, and he took Midoriya's hand in his.
"...Do... Should I wait for you outside or something?" he asked.
Midoriya's hand, as warm as his smile, turned in his grip and he squeezed back.
"It's okay. It might take a while. I promise to be back for dinner though."
"I'll hold you to that," Natsuo replied feeling his shoulders get heavy. 

-

Dabi frowned. "Who's that?"
Twice blanched, and anyone that coud make Twice take a step back and cross his arms and turn away like a sullen crab trying to take cover in his shell, had Natsuo's full attention and all the dread in his gut felt like 
"Overhaul-san," Midoriya greeted politely as he gave a bow, "What brings you here?"
"I haven't heard from you in a while," Overhaul replied, "If I didn't check on the orphanage, I wouldn't have thought you kicked the bucket in a gate somewhere." He tilted his head, looking dismissive and bored, and for a moment, Natsuo was reminded of the blank stare he got from his dad, and felt his heart swell with a cold anger. "Glad to see that I'm wrong."
"Yeah, Sensei let me know that you came by everyday," Midoriya replied and gave another deep bow, "Thank you for looking after there while I was gone."
Chisaki waved his hand. "Think nothing of it," he replied. It was out of personal interest. I'm more than pleased if you would see me in a good light."
But Midoriya had this smile, one that Natsuo hadn't ever seen before, that reminded him of the way Fuyumi smiled when she endeared by a child doing something particularly stupid. 
"Let me introduce you to my party," he said, "GThis is my party members. From left to right," he brought his hand up and motioned at Twice, "Twice-san, Dabi-san, and Natsuo-san."
"When I heard that you were partnering up with Todorokis', I didn't know what to expect," Overhaul replied, eyes cool. Still, he had some manners, even if they were shit, and he gave a shallow bow, "Thanks for looking after Midoriya."
"Uh... yeah," Natsuo nodded his head. "And you are...?"
"Midoriya and I take care of that orphanage," Overhaul said, at the same time Midoriya spoke.
"Chisaki-san and I used to Shovel together."
The two stopped and stared at each other.
"Midoriya has done a lot for me," Overhaul added, and at the same time, Midoriya tried.
"Chisaki-san has done a lot for me."
there was another beat of silence before the two broke out in matching smiles of fondness that Natsuo hated. 
"No one would believe that we worked together before," Overhaul sighed.
"S-sorry," Midoriya dipped his head forward.
With a sigh, Overhaul reached over and ruffled his hair. He turned to the others, "Well, that's the gist of it. If we had a better party, I would have taken Midoriya in, so I'm grateful for you extra assistance."
"Your party is fine!" Midoriya exclaimed, and no doubt, this was something that they talked about many times before too.
Oh, Natsuo thought, and it felt so stupid that he didn't know and didn't ever think of it. 
Midoriya had other offers to join other parties. It felt so stupid, ecause of course he did. And still, for whatever reason, he chose to stay with him and Touya, who couldn't clear anything than a C-Rank.

Midoriya stared at the screen, but he didn't look surprised. 
"Yes, there is a new theory that gates are influenced by hunters. Since hunters have high amounts of magic, the gathering of hunters in an area could influence the rankings of the gates in their area."
"Then, if that's the case, if the reason why Japan's experiencing so many high level gates because of their new Supporter?"
"Well, it's too soon to jump to any conclusions, but it's definately a possibility. After all, all countries that have high magic concentration experience higher-level gates."
Midoriya watched on.
"Don't," Natuso hesitated, "Don't pay attention to that-"
The young man turned and smiled at him, and Natsuo understood that strength wasn't something that was measured by devices or statistics. And the kindness and the supposed naivity that everyone always criticised Midoriya for suddenly didn't feel like a weakness at all.
"Do you think it's real?" he asked.
And Natsuo felt his heart clench.
"No," he said, because he didn't want to think that Midoriya caused such awful atrocities. "Its like that thing, you know? Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Except we know. Gates came first. Hunters came as a result of them."
Midoriya took a deep breath, and kept careful control over his expressio, but Natsuo could hear how his breath shook.
"Okay," he said, and Natsuo reached over to take his hand.
It was cold, leaving him to wonder how long he had endured that freezing kind of lonliness.
