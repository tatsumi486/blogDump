### sick and tired

"So, why are we heading over there?"
Izuku looked up from the map and Fatgum rubbed the back of his head.
"Sorry, I'm not the brightest," he said. "But it's gotta be important if you wanna look again, right?" 
There was a brief moment of silence before Izuku stood up. Internally, several of the others mourned that their talk was over already, until the young man leaned over and pulled a folded piece of paper out of his bag. He motioned Fatgum closer as he opened the map over the desk. He grabbed a few papercips from the drawer and placed them on the map carefully.
"Imagine each paperclip to be where he fought in the last month," he said. Several others craned their necks to get a closer look.
"...Oh," Fatgum said, "These buildings haven't been touched." Seeing it like this made it really obvious what was going on.
Izuku nodded his head. "TWe're going to head over and break into four teams. Two teams to cover the building. One team for perimeter, and then our emergency back-up team."
Tapping his finger to the map, Izuku looked back at Fatgum. "Does that... make sense?"
Fatgum nodded. "Crystal clear. Thanks for explaining it."
"...You're really good at making a mental map in your head," Dabi said, leaning over the other side of the desk. 
A frown stretched Izuku's face, as though Dabi had insulted him instead of complimented him and he looked back at the map, ignoring him. "I'm pretty sure it's going to be a nest. Given the fact that there were at least 40 of them outside, there will be a minimun of 10 mutants, and probably four monsters."
Izuku looked back up. He tilted his head.
"Based off of reports of the walkers and the one mutant that we fought earlier, they split off parts of themselves, lodge into something solid like seeds, and then shoot out arrows from there. The longer the battle, the harder it will get. As always, decapitation or severe head trauma will kill them."
The young man paused then, looking at the map and then took a deep breath. 
"If there comes a chance that you have to choose between your life and theirs, prioritize coming back alive."
Cheeks darkening, he grabbed his backpack and made for the door.
"We leave in 20," and he was gone.
Hawks covered his mouth with one hand, horribly endeared.
"Told you so," Yamada nudged Aizawa with an elbow, "He doesn't hate us."

"Have you been called for any meetings recently?" Aizawa asked, leaning against the windowframe.
"...Can't say I have been," Sasaki replied. He paused and then turned around. "Shit."
"Yeah," Aizawa narrowed his eyes as he watched Izuku came in, blood running down his shoulder and trailing in behind him. Running to him, he could hear the yells 
They had noticed, they had all noticed, how cold Izuku had gotten. It felt like they were back there, when Izuku first woke up without his helmet. 
He didn't even know what had happened.

"We were doing so well!" Tsukauchi yelled, his frustrations peaking. "We had meetings! He told us where he was heading to!"
His hands came up to his hair, the mixture of incompetency and his fraying emotions causing a swirling storm to brew inside of him. It felt like he was desperately trying to climb up the side of a mountain, only to slip from something he didn't see and now he was back at the foot of the mountain.
"We-We-" his hands dropped to his side. "Where did we go wrong?"
Yagi pursed his lips, his hands clasped in prayer in front of him. His mind wracked his memories for anything, someone who stared too long, someone who stood too close, and all he could see was the almost smile on Izuku's lips. 
"I don't get it," Tsukauchi said, his mindscape teetering dangerously, as it had been for quite some time already, but they were so close to coming to a mend and now all of it was falling apart again. "We're just... starting all over again? But as long as we don't know what caused it this time, we won't know what the hell reset us."
"Naomasa," Yagi reached out for him, placing his hand on his shoulder. "Don't lose heart. There may be an underlying reason to all of this."
He squeezed again, and reminded his old friend of the blind faith they had in someone they didn't even know the name of.
"Izuku does everything for a reason," he said. 
Tsukauchi's back straightened. 
"Yes," he replied back. "He does, doesn't he?"
It could be anything. Izuku was sniffing out a traitor. Izuku wanted this to be a surprise. It could literally be anything, but if Tsukauchi and Yagi had learned anything based off of habits, they knew that Midoriya kept everyone's best interest at heart. Whatever he was doing, he did because he thought that it would be best for everyone else's comfort. 
Then, they needed to support him the best they could, anyway that they could.

Izuku returned with claw marks across his back and arm. They glistened, a shiny, glossy dark red as he moved. Next to him, fretting nervously, Mr Compress held several bandages.
"Please, Izuku-chan, I insist that you at least bandage it-"
But Izuku made straight for the main office. Staring up at the large map they had on the wall, he grabbed four green push-pins and pinned them along the street. He took a step back and stared for a moment longer before he turned around to leave.
At that point, Mr Compress stood firmly in the doorframe.
"Izuku-chan, I-"
But Izuku wasted no time kicking him in the shin, and when he crouched forward, shoved him backwards by the shoulder. The man sprawled backwards, and without another glance, Izuku left the room.
"What the hell is going on?" Endeavor asked, furrowed brow and big frown. 
"Ah." He threw a dismissive glance he gave the larger man as he rubbed his shin. "Uh, nothing for you to worry about, Hero-san."
"Doesn't seem like it," Endeavor replied, eyes narrowed as he

"It's worth it," Ban Yeoryung cried. She wiped at her eyes and rubbed them hard, even red-rimmed, they were breathtaking. Fat tears ran down her face and the words came out strangled, and still, she was beautiful. "It doesn't hurt. I can do it."
"...Yeoryung?" Dan-i whispered back. As the main lead, she supposed it wouldn't be this easy.
"I'll protect it. The world where-where we eat ice cream together. The world where we s-sleep next to each other. I'll do it," she said. "I'll protect the world that I share with my Dan-i."
Dan-i, on occasion, wondered what had happened in their past, that this beautiful woman was so loyal to her. The original Ham Dan-i must have been someone equally beautiful to have earned that loyalty. 
"Yeo-ryung," she said, collecting her hands, and smiled. "Having you here is enough for me." She leaned in, pushing her long hair behind her ear, and grinned. "Every day I get to spend with you is my most precious treasure."
