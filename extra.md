"I'm quirkless," Midoriya replied, waving his hand. 
"You don't want to change that?"
The young man laughed back, a sounds bright and small like Christmas lights on in the dead of the night. 
"No way," he said, "I don't want to be invincible."

### saying hello

Midoriya sighed as he pressed his hand against his rib. It wasn't broken, he's pretty sure, but god did it hurt. 

But more importantly, he looked over to where the small child was. 

"Are you okay?" he asked quietly, "Are you hurt?" he clarified, because there was no way the kid was okay. This kid probably just lost everyone and everything. Midoriya turned over, and his heart ached from how young he looked, wide-eyed and lanky, when the kid suddenly launched himself into his chest.

Heaving cries came out, ringing Midoriya's ears, but he still wrapped his arms around the kid. Rubbing his back in circles, he hummed quietly, hopeful that the sound of another person, their vibrations and their heartbeat, would provide some level of comfort for him. 

The kid cried and cried, his head against Midoriya's chest, and the older man rubbed his back as soothing as he could. After several minutes, the kid started to quiet down, sniffling loudly, and Midoriya ached to do this but-

"...It's not safe here," he said, "Do... Do you have someplace to be? I can walk you..." his voice trailed when he saw the way fresh tears came and pursed his lips. "I see." He took a deep breath and took a dive, "It... It won't be comfortable, but do you want to come with me?" 

"Can... can I?"

The blond looked up and sniffled again. 

"Is... Is that okay? I'm not... Not strong. Or smart or..." 

Midoriya melted. "Of course," he replied, voice quiet as to not alarm him as he nodded his head, "You can stay as long as you want." 

The tears that spilled out of his eyes and down his face weren't tears that came from someone who lost something, but someone remembering that they didn't lose everything. 

A blubbering mess, he nodded his head. Taking Midoriya's hand into a death grip, he shuffled along behind him.

Despite the situation, he smiled back. He squeezed back and quietly led him forward. In his head, he was already trying to figure out where he could get this kid to go. In his pack, he had already cleaned out all the actual soups and stuff, but hopefully, they would have something else for him to have. Hopefully.

If not, he hoped that the kid behind him would be okay with some old trail mixes. It was all Midoriya had, at this time. Hopefully, when they break into the supermarket parking lot, they could find something to salvage in the trucks.

### Extremely Bad Fortune (but Honestly Not as Bad as Expectations)

[but i have that doc:

- Kind Nightmare -> the closet that's a demon portal to whatever nonscense 
- solo lvl -> a lot of gates everywhere
- kingless quirkless: ruler!midoriya (brighter and happier because everything is new and beautiful, and something worth fighting for) & his pieces!harem to tour the remains of human civilization post demon-war (that they're still fighting)
- emissary AU that's human!midoriya tryna keep humans->demons human.
- dark continent: human!midoriya with demons (who are wary of humans that live like shooting stars, briefly but undeniably)
- Extremely Bad Fortune -> summoner? contract? make this the Territory Game? Witch hunt for Quirkless, but also no chance of winning against Misfortune without a King(?) -> only quirkless have "magic" (and even than, that's proportional to the people that they are contracted to). crawling back from no-society wartorn mess

Summary: Modern-Fantasy AU. A long, long time ago, a powerless man went and fought god and won. As a result, the world was thrown into darkness and disarray. Even now, the powerless, the Quirkless, and the meritless were often viewed as a symbol of misfortune and evil. If at all possible, Midoriya Izuku would like the world to see him as a [Hero] instead a harbinger of mass-destruction.
>> honestly the ffx au no one wanted.

#### Notes:

- two types of people
  - Land of Rising Sun -> ie daywalkers/people who lived under the sun (heroes + civilians). Those who fight monsters are "heroes"
  - Land of Eternal Night -> ie nightwalkers/people who don't live under the light (our villains). Those who fight monsters are "champions"
- Midoriya wants to become a Pillar of the World. Savio or whatever. Amassing a group of people who also want to stop the encroaching darkness/apoc
- also knows that he's gonna die at the end of this. (and become a sacrifice to appease the god and let them all go)

### Unforgotten Anger

"Because of you- because of your kind- do you know how we had to live?!" Tensei shouted out, grabbing his shoulders. "Children we had to abandon! Disaster after disaster! Safe zones destroyed in seconds and you- you think that you can fix that? What the hell can you do?"

## elysium

Summary: AU. Midoriya Izuku is summoned to a world where he's some cute pet or a lamb awaiting slaughter for anyone that was strong enough. Or so he thought.

### notes

- society cannot mate/have children because they're essentially all gods & stuff
- thus the summoning ritual
  - so they summon like it's gacha
  - whoever is summoned becomes the "children" of society (age regressed to young/teen)
- having a quirk means impurities, those ppl usually end up becoming grunts/work ppl for society 

### bidding increases

"Yeah, usually when someone tries to escape, their value goes down," Present Mic said, "This is the first time we've experienced the opposite."

Midoriya stared at the chains on his wrist, eyes flitting over the lock and then where Vlad King leaned against the door.

"...If you're making money off of me," he looked back at the blond in front of him, "Does that mean I can start making demands?"

Present Mic laughed back, and calmed down just as fast. "You know, that's the thing." He leaned back in his seat, "I wanna take you for myself."

"No thanks."

"Which is exactly what I figured you would say," he said. He leaned forward, propping his head on his hand as he grinned at Midoriya. "You know, anyone would be happy to be mine."

Midoriya nodded, "I know."

"You know?"

The young man hesitated and then shook his head, "I'm not... I'm not looking for happiness."

"Oh yeah? Then, what are you looking for?"

And then, Midoriya gave this helpless smile, like he was looking at something fond. 

"So," he said instead, "Who do I submit my list of demands to?"

"I'll take them," Eraserhead said from the seat next to Present Mic. "What do you want?"

"Antibodies," he replied without hesitation, and when both men tensed in front of him, quickly raised his hands in front of him, "Not for me, but some of the others. They're... They're finally letting me closer to them, so I think that will let me help them out."

"You know, most of them are going to hurt you again."

Midoriya didn't even blink.

"I want antibodies."

Eraserhead covered his face and took a deep breath. Next to him, Present Mic pursed his lips before he sighed and nodded.

"Alright," the blond said, "We'll make it happen."

Midoriya smiled, a small thing but genuine and warm in a way they only saw in moments like this. 

Looking at them, no one would think that they were prisoner and warden. Or if they could, no one would ever guess which one was the prisoner. 

### no way back

"Look, there's no way back. No one's ever done it before. The fact that we can even summon this way is impossible and a miracle in and of itself."

"Yeah, that makes sense," Midoriya replied back, "I just got here."

Aizawa's expression stilled, and Midoriya gave a sheepish grin back.

"It sounds crazy, right? For me, this is all pretty crazy too. I was... I was going to start my last year of high school. My whole life, right about to open in front of me. I didn't have any idea what I wanted to be."

The warden leaned backwards against the wall, eyes staring at the young man and watching the way he stared at his own fingers.

"And then, here I am, a place with two moons." He rubbed the back of his neck. "Where I'm from, there was one. This whole thing is pretty crazy. No, I think I passed crazy a while back, so why not?" He looked up at the older man, "Why not be crazy a little longer, and get an answer for this?"

### memories

"The longer you spend here, the more your memories of the other world will fade," Twice said, "So can't you just, just forget it? I-I'll do my best, I promise, I swear to you I will. S-so can't you just. Please. Please." 

His words trailed into an obscure mess of syllables and pleas as his voice broke and the tears started to fall. 

Midoriya placed his arms around Twice, collecting him against his chest. The older man wrapped his arms around his waist tightly and squeezed. His knees fell to the ground, and he rubbed his face against Midoriya's stomach. 

Midoriya ran his fingers through Twice's hair.

"You don't look surprised," Hawks said, crossing his arms over his chest as he eyed Midoriya.

"...I mean, I figured this would be the case," he replied, "Because I never heard any adult talk about going back. Or the things that they ate or the things that they loved." Absent-mindedly, he ran his fingers through Twice's hair. "And to begin with, our memories fade as we grow older. That's just normal."

None of them said it, but it lingered in all of their minds. If Midoriya returned, then with time, he would probably forget this world to. If the summoning (or reverse-summoning in this case) didn't do it, then it would be something else.
