### ch 4?

"Hey. Slave."

Aizawa opened his eyes. He hadn't been sleeping (hard to when his Master slept right next to him, and there was half a dragon purring on the otherside of this very cramped bed), but that didn't make any of this more bearable. He would have left the bed long ago, but his small Master had a deathgrip on his hand. If he tugged on his hand, his heart tightened (obviously because of the slave-seal and nothing else) and his Master's brows furrowed and he mumbled, and it just wasn't worth the effort and the tinge of pain. 

He turned his head, and saw the bright blue eyes of Dabi glared at him. Well, glaring at their hands. Aizawa stared for a moment longer, and then they made eye-contact, smirked.

Dabi could hang all over his sweet Reverse-Scale, but Aizawa can't leave until his Master allowed it. And from the way he frowned, it was something that he was well aware of.

The older man stared at him for a moment, but he was powerless to do anything about the situation. He was just a slave. He turned on his side, placed his arm over his Master's waist. Almost immediately, the young man scooted closer to him, all but forcing himself into Aizawa's embrace. Helpless, Aizawa could do nothing but be a good slave. His eyes met with Dabi and smirked.

Poor bastard lost his husband to a slave, the morning after their consummation. He couldn't imagine how he felt.

-

"... No fire in bed," Midoriya's voice was stern.

"But he-" Dabi pointed at Aizawa, and hissed out, "-started it!"

The young man stared back at the dragon, unrelenting as he crossed his arms over his chest. From where Aizawa stood, holding the basket with their breakfast, he could hear the dragon grinding his teeth together. Perhaps his stare proved to be too much, because he finally turned away. Crossing his arms over his chest, he walked to lean against the windowsill and glare outside with a scowl.

With a sigh, the young man turned to his slave, "T-Thank you for getting breakfast again," he said, still wrapped up in the blanket, the one that wasn't burnt. At the very least, the mattress didn't burn, and they would probably only have to worry about 

-

"Uhm," he gave a nervous laugh, "It actually goes down."

"You... What?"

"That's part of the blessing," he explained, "That I uh... If I don't engage in uhm... intimate activities for too long, my level will actually go down."

Aizawa's jaw fell open. "What?"

Dabi tilted his head, eyebrows furrowed, he asked, "Is that why you're strong for your level?"

"Yeah, the stat-bonus doesn't go away, but it becomes uhm... uncomfortable."

The way he danced around the topic made both men think that there was something else that he wasn't talking about. 

"B-but that's not to pressure you guys or anything! Taking breaks and stuff is good! And-and I understand if there is something else you want to do, or someone else you want to hold. I-I imagine that being with the same person all the time could make you stir-crazy, so you don't have to think that you-"

Was that how he felt? Aizawa thought. He turned his head to see Dabi's still features. His expression was blank as he stared forward at him. He hated how similar they were. 

Dabi stared and instead asked, "Do you get tired of me, too?"

"What? Of course not!"

"Then, why would you think that I wouldn't want you?" he asked. "That I would tire of you?"

Aizawa thought about it, the way Dabi's eyes lingered on Midoriya's figure. He remembered watching the way his lips curled into a smile, and he wondered if Dabi knew that he only smiled like that when they found a flowerbed. 

"W-Well, of course I can't tire of you," his Master said, eyesbrows furrowing. "But that's not the case for you, right? I took you out of that cave, but now you're seeing the world," he said. "So you're probably seeing how big the world is."

Dabi's hand shot out and grabbed his wrist tightly.

"I have," he said quietly, "I have seen the world before. I... I went into that cave because I wanted to. Have you ever thought about why?"

"I..." he hesitated.

"The world," he said quietly, "Isn't that big."

In those moments, Aizawa wondered if they even knew that he was here. Feeling as though he was intruding on something, he looked away. That raw look on Dabi's face didn't suit him at all. The thoughts of dragons, big and large and majestic and powerful, seemed to dissolve away the longer he spent time together with him.

Aside from that, he looked to his Master. Why wasn't he informed of this? Why didn't he ever mention it? Was it something that he could ask? Was it something that he could mention? It felt wrong, like it was above him, and he kept his mouth shut. 

### yamada's question

"Well, I'm sure that we can figure something out so that you don't get tired of us," Yamada said, eyes bright. Now that his hair was down and to the side, Aizawa saw where his horn parted his hair. One sat, coming out of his head above his ear, straight and point, but he didn't look unbalanced.

His heart ached at the thought that his friend was already used to the missing weight. 

"I-I won't-"

"We'll probably pick someone up by the end of this mountain-range," Dabi added from the side.

"One per mountain," Fatgum added, a boisterous laugh coming out of him.

"Like our fucking room wasn't cramped enough as it was," Shigaraki growled out, trudging slowly at the end of the group. 

"So, where are we heading to?"

Aizawa flinched, because it wasn't Right for slaves to ask questions.

"In the steepest valley, there's an entrance to a labrynth," his Master replied, "I would like to go there."

"A labrynth? Why?"

And even stranger was that this Master of his answered. There was no bitter remark, no lashing of punishment, and Aizawa felt wrong-footed. 

"Yamada," he called out, "Watch it."

The blond flinched backwards, and ducked his head, "Uh, sorry, Master. I didn't mean to-"

"It's okay," his Master replied, "You don't have to apologize for that. If there's something I don't want to answer, I'll let you know."

Yamada stared at him for a moment, eyes wide before a grin curled his lips up, and he gave a loud laugh. He walked up to the young man and extended his hand out.

"Can we hold hands?"

His face flushing darkly, the young man laughed back. "Y-Yeah, that sounds," he cleared his throat, "good."

Dabi frowned, Fatgum furrowed his brows, and Aizawa gnashed his teeth. 


## scenario 

>> Endeavor/Deku, Hawks/Deku, Ingenium/Deku, Gang Orca/Deku.
>> idk but i really want Fatgum/Deku too...


### nightmares (Endeavor)

Endeavor woke up with a jolt, and all but jumped to his feet. Heart pounding in his chest, he looked around wildly. 

"Enji?"

He looked over to where Gang Orca frowned back at him.

"Are you alright?" 

"I..."

He looked around again, and finally found Deku's sleeping figure. Sleeping comfortably against Fatgum, he stared for a moment longer. Quietly but swiftly, he walked over and place his hand under Deku's nose, just to check if he was breathing. He pulled his hand back before he touched him, and covered his face. With a deep sigh, he ran his hand through his hair, feeling as though he was losing his mind.

"Yes," he said, getting up. He could see Hawks, had no dobuts that the blond was awake, and then Ingenium, who slept with one hand on his sword (for good reason). "I'm alright."

"Sounds like a load of garbage," Gang Orca replied back, "but if you don't mind, I'd like the company."

Endeavor stared back at Gang Orca and then nodded. Taking a seat in front of him, the two sat as the fire crackled in its final embers.

"...Thank you," Endeavor said in a voice quiet enough to be smoothered by the fire. Louder, he added, "I'll take care of the watch from here."

"Alright," the whaleman said. "I still got a few hours."
