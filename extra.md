"It's worth it," Ban Yeoryung cried. She wiped at her eyes and rubbed them hard, even red-rimmed, they were breathtaking. Fat tears ran down her face and the words came out strangled, and still, she was beautiful. "It doesn't hurt. I can do it."
"...Yeoryung?" Dan-i whispered back. As the main lead, she supposed it wouldn't be this easy.
"I'll protect it. The world where-where we eat ice cream together. The world where we s-sleep next to each other. I'll do it," she said. "I'll protect the world that I share with my Dan-i."
Dan-i, on occasion, wondered what had happened in their past, that this beautiful woman was so loyal to her. The original Ham Dan-i must have been someone equally beautiful to have earned that loyalty. 
"Yeo-ryung," she said, collecting her hands, and smiled. "Having you here is enough for me." She leaned in, pushing her long hair behind her ear, and grinned. "Every day I get to spend with you is my most precious treasure."
