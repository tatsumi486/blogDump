"Hey. Slave."

Aizawa opened his eyes. He hadn't been sleeping (hard to when his Master slept right next to him, and there was half a dragon purring on the otherside of this very cramped bed), 

## scenario 

>> Endeavor/Deku, Hawks/Deku, Ingenium/Deku, Gang Orca/Deku.
>> idk but i really want Fatgum/Deku too...


### nightmares (Endeavor)

Endeavor woke up with a jolt, and all but jumped to his feet. Heart pounding in his chest, he looked around wildly. 

"Enji?"

He looked over to where Gang Orca frowned back at him.

"Are you alright?" 

"I..."

He looked around again, and finally found Deku's sleeping figure. Sleeping comfortably against Fatgum, he stared for a moment longer. Quietly but swiftly, he walked over and place his hand under Deku's nose, just to check if he was breathing. He pulled his hand back before he touched him, and covered his face. With a deep sigh, he ran his hand through his hair, feeling as though he was losing his mind.

"Yes," he said, getting up. He could see Hawks, had no dobuts that the blond was awake, and then Ingenium, who slept with one hand on his sword (for good reason). "I'm alright."

"Sounds like a load of garbage," Gang Orca replied back, "but if you don't mind, I'd like the company."

Endeavor stared back at Gang Orca and then nodded. Taking a seat in front of him, the two sat as the fire crackled in its final embers.

"...Thank you," Endeavor said in a voice quiet enough to be smoothered by the fire. Louder, he added, "I'll take care of the watch from here."

"Alright," the whaleman said. "I still got a few hours."
