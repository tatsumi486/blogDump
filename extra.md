- aizawa walks deku home after infirmary incident like "why isn't anyone picking up? I can't let you just go home like this, so I'll be taking you home."

"...Excuse me?"
Aizawa tilted his head at Midoriya, his expression softening as he took the seat next to him.
"It's not... 

Just then, there was a polite knock on the door. "Midoriya?" Vlad King's voice sounded, "Do you want to go home?" He pushed the door open as he finished his sentence. His eyes fell to Eraserhead, and then he looked to the side where Midoriya was resting.
"Sensei," Midoriya said quietly, sitting up. 
On the other side of him, Aizawa's gaze looked from Midoriya to Kan, and then back. 
"Eraser," Kan said, nodding his head, "I can take him back."
And Aizawa narrowed his eyes because there's something strange about this whole thing. 
"I-I'm fine," Midoriya said, like they didn't have eyes and couldn't see how pale his complexion was, riddled in bandages for injuries that Recovery Girl couldn't finish for the day, and Aizawa shook his head.
"We can't let you go home like that," he said, "For your safety and our peace of mind, I'll," he paused, glaring at Kan as though to dare him to argue, and then continued, "take him. As his homeroom teacher, you're my direct responsibility. It'll be more efficient than to send someone else and wait for a report."
Kan's hands clenched into fists by his side, and Midoriya looked at the older man, concern etching his face.
The thought that Midoriya looked to 1-B's homeroom teacher before Aizawa made him frown. Whatever was going on between them was clearly not helping Midoriya, in any way, shape, or form.
And Kan, instead of asking for help or assistance when the going got worse, remained tight-lipped. That, Aizawa wouldn't stand for.
"Normally, we'd wait for your parent or guardian to come and get you, but we haven't gotten any responses. So, I'll send you."
"B-but Aizawa-sensei, I-I don't want to be a bother-"
Aizawa's eyebrow twitched. A bother? Was that what Kan was telling him? That it would bother him, and that's why he shouldn't ask for help? Deep in his gut, he felt a fire stoke. He looked to Midoriya sharply, and spoke clearly.
"Midoriya, you're health and wellbeing isn't a bother to me," he said. "You're not a bother. You're a student. I'm your teacher. This is the bare minimum of what I should be doing."

"...Midoriya?"
Aizawa wasn't sure what he was expecting when he saw the young man standing at the mouth of an alleyway. The thought that Midoriya was at least two stations over from where his apartment was lingered in his head, but his eyes focused on what was in his arms.
Wrapped in Midoriya's jacket, in his arms, were two small kittens in a shoebox. His heart clenched painfully at the sight of them, dry while Midoriya stood soaked in the rain, meowing up at them.
"A-Aizawa-sensei!" Midoriya said, and eyeing his teacher, took a step back. Midoriya didn't flinch from Aizawa when he fucked him over the coffee table, he didn't stray or shy in the classroom like he should have, but now, when there were kittens in his arms, he took a step back. "T-This, this isn't what it looked like?"
"Well, it looks like you're caught in the rain with some kittens," Aizawa replied back, "C'mon, let's get you dried off first."
"I... what?"
"My apartment is around the corner." 
"But-"
"And bring the cats."
He turned around to lead the way. In his mind, he was already thinking about the closest vet. He would have to check if they were open, but he'd take care of this for Midoriya.
And hopefully, Midoriya would believe in him next time.

Midoriya came into his apartment.
"Stay there," he said, "Lemme grab you a towel first."
He threw his umbrella to the side, kicked his shoes off and shucked his jacket over his couch. Joggging to get some towels, he returned just as fast. 
"Go shower. I don't want you getting sick. I have some clothes you can wear. It'll be uncomfortable, but it'll only be until your clothes dry."
"I-It's okay, I just-"
"Go. Midoriya."
"Y-Yes sir."
Aizawa took the box of small kittens, heart growing soft at the sight of them mewling at him. He took them to the kitchen, and figured that he should order Midoriya something to eat. He hadn't eaten anything either, and figured that some fried chicken would be fine.
Not nutritious, by any stretch of definition, but it would fill their stomachs and hopefully raise Midoriya's spirits.
Midoriya came out in record speed. Aizawa looked up, barely done ordering, and his eyes widened when he saw the ugly bruise spanning over Midoriya's shoulder. And a long career in finding people too late, after a bad day, gave him an understanding on why Midoriya wasn't bothered by Aizawa's presence despite all that conspired between them.


Eventually, Aizawa would understand. Midoriya took a step back because there was something he wanted to protect. The thought would haunt him for a long time.
