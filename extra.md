Dabi stretched out and rubbed his neck.
"You okay?" Midoriya asked, you've been rubbing your neck all day."
"Slept wrong," the man replied back, yawning again. "I'm not used to sleeping up here."
"Cave-goblin," Aizawa muttered under his breath.
Midoriya gave his slave a frown, and then gave a quiet sigh when the man refused to make eye-contact with him. He turned back to Dabi, with a concerned frown.
"Do you think you can keep going?" he asked. "We want to be on the other side of the forest by sundown."
Blue eyes peered at his human for a moment before he gave a wolfish grin. He gave Midoriya a quick-up down and hummed, "Well, I think I can be enticed to."
Midoriya's face turned bright red, and Dabi licked his lips.
"Oh," he said, "You..."

-

"I mean, he clearly wasn't good in the sack if you picked me up," Dabi said, motioning at Aizawa, "So sell him off. Let's buy a bed with that money."
"No."
Midoriya didn't hesitate to shut that idea down. Staring Dabi down, he spoke clearly.
"I won't sell him."
Aizawa felt his heart stutter.
"Then why did you get me?"
"I didn't get you, you followed me out!"
"You proposed to me. How could I ever turn down the proposal from someone as cute as you?"
Midoriya's face flushed. "I-It wasn't a pr-proposal!"
And that damned grin on Dabi's face was already back. He placed his hand over his heart, feigning his hurt, "Boo-hoo. I've left my cave for two days and my husband is already getting ready to throw me away."
"That's not true! I won't throw you away!"
"Then, you'll keep me?"
Aizawa shook his head. He walked into that one.
"Until you ... find your home, a real home," Midoriya replied back. 
Blue eyes stared at Midoriya for a moment longer before he gazed into the fire. He was quiet just long enough for Midoriya's flush to fade by a fraction.
"Ah, I've left my den for two days and my husband is already trying to get rid of me."
"I'm not trying to get rid of you! I just said you can stay as long as you want!"
And Dabi rubbed his chest and gave a big frown, "I didn't even realize that I could be hurt by someone's words."
"What..." Midoriya heaved a great sigh, "Does it hurt a lot?"
"Oh, if only someone could ease the pain."
And Midoriya chewed his cheek before he sighed. Idiot.
"Alright, what should I do?"
Dropping all the dramatics, Dabi opened his arms.
"Come over here," he purred. 
When Midoriya hesitated, he placed his hand over his heart, "Ouch, ouch, ouch."
"Okay! I'm coming!"
And Aizawa couldn't believe that he was bought by someone who fell for this trick every time. Midoriya gave a quiet squeak when Dabi yanked him into his lap, his lips already coming up to capture his humans.

-

"Yeah, I already imprinted on you. You're my [Reverse Scale]," Dabi said. 
"You what?!" Aizawa jumped up to his feet, shocked. 
Blue eyes stared at the two of them blankly, "Yeah." He spoke so frankly, like it was obvious that he did this.
"What..." Midoriya raised his hand, like he was in class, and flinched when the other two turned to him as one, "What does... that mean?"
"It means we're married, sweetheart," Dabi said, flinging another spark into their campfire.
The young man gave a scandalized gasp, "B-but we didn't even date!"
Aizawa's hands dropped to his side as he stared at Midoriya in shock, "Is that your concern right now?" he asked while Dabi fell over in his laughter.
"Ah, I mean, isn't... Is it permament?"
"No," Dabi replied back, "I can take it back."
Midoriya turned to Aizawa, "Then, what's the problem?"
"You don't know?!" the slave gaped, "A Dragon's [Reverse Scale] is-"
He was kicked in the back, and bit his tongue. With a scowl, he turned back around, and Dabi's cold gaze leveled him.
"...A Dragon's [Reverse Scale] is...?" Midoriya looked forom Aizawa to Dabi and back. "That sounds like something important that I should know."
"It means you have some marriagal duties," the man said, "Like showering me in your attention and affection."
"I... I don't think that's all," he pouted.
Dabi shrugged, "What would humans know about Dragon mating habits?"
"But truly? You can call this back anytime? It won't... hurt you?"
Dabi stared at him, like he was looking at something peculiar, and he gave a hum. 
"Does it matter?"
"I... If there comes a time, one day, that being with me is more painful than it is nice," Midoriya spoke quietly, "I want you to live happier."
"Really? Like how?"
The young man hesitated, searching his mind for an example of an awful thing he could do to another person. His expression brightened when he found one, and he turned to Dabi.
"Like I could hurt you!" And as an afterthought, clarified, "with my hands."
Dabi stared for a moment and then suddenly flinched. He yanked his hand to his chest, cradling it with his other hand. "Ouch!"
Eyes wide, Midoriya rushed forward. Brows pinched in concern, the young man gasped, "Are you okay?" he asked. 
His eyes darted around the area, to see what had hurt Dabi, and the older man stared back at him. Meanwhile, Dabi's lips twisted into an exasperated grin and he dropped his hands. He chuckled as he Midoriya quickly took his hand into his and looked it over.
"Are you okay? Was it a sharp pain? A dull one? I don't see an injury, so a status inflicted-"
"He's pretending," Aizawa called from further away, seething and disapproving. 
"What? Why would he pretend-"
"I can't wait to see how you'll hurt me," Dabi said, leaning in to kiss his cheek, "My dear Reverse Scale."
Midoriya blinked, the past ew seconds replaying slowly in his head. He covered his face and groaned.
"I fell for it again," he said, like there has ever been a instance where he hadn't. 
Despite the bright atmosphere, however, Aizawa was not fooled. A Dragon's [Reverse Scale] was something that he'd only heard of in legends. A Dragon's most sensitive spot, and one that would bring maelstrom and desolation if it was hurt. He would have never thought that he would ever see a Dragon and his [Reverse Scale] in his lifetime, since they were such an old legend, but nothing was ever easy with his Master. The dumbass probably had no idea about the weight of the words he was throwing around.
For a Dragon to break away from their [Reverse Scale], was a dragon who would never take flight or breath fire again. It wouldn't be anything greater than a worm that squirmed on the ground until it died of grief. According to legend, that's how the rivers were made, from long streams of Dragons who lost their [Reverse Scale] and died, unable to move or anything while they waited for death.
Or maybe Aizawa was reading too deeply into this. Legends were often blown out of proportions. He turned to where Dabi ruffled Midoriya's head, eyes just a little bit brighter than the sky above them. 

-

"So, why haven't you freed him yet?" Dabi asked. 
"If I free him right now," Midoriya replied quietly, "It'll be a death sentence."
"Yeah, but he'll have the freedom to choose."
Midoriya frowned, "If 

-

"You're right! You did it!" Aizawa's words poured out like broken glass, scratching his throat on the way up, "You're right! I get it! That you make the world a beautiful place and that my entire life up to this point was just a waste! You did it! I regret it! And I hate myself even more every day because I want to spend it with you!"
Midoriya stared at him, eyes wide and jaw clenched tightly.
"You did it," he said, eyes red as he stared at Midoriya, "I want to live with you."
The young man stared back.
"But you have no intention of staying, don't you?"
Aizawa grabbed his hands and pulled him close.
"Why didn't you just kill me? I could have lived this whole time without ever knowing what I didn't have. If you can't take me with you, just kill me."



### way back home [afterwards: ver Deku]

"...Why are they calling me Izuku?"
Takami's smile froze on his face, but he kept himself under control. 
"Isn't that your name?" he asked, keeping his voice light as he passed the plate of cut apples to him. He took one and munched on it. There was no reason to think so, but he hoped that Midoriya could see that there was someone that was willing to cut apples for him at the hospital. 
Midoriya stared at the plate of cut apples, "I've always been Deku," he said. "Useless, quirkless Deku."
His hands trembled as he held them in his hands.
"It feels like I'm the wrong body, living someone else's life," he said quietly. 
Takami could only imagine. Everything about Midoriya felt like an impossibility. From the different types of people he associated with to the incidents he always ended up in, Takami would have never thought that people like Midoriya could be real. 
"The person you cut this for," he said quietly, looking at the untouched plate of apples, "isn't here."
Takami chuckled. 
"I'm here to cut apples for a patient trying to recover," he said. "Community service, if you will. And while doing so, I met someone that I wanted to be friends with." He pushed the plate of apples towards him.
"Even... though I'm just Deku?"
The blond kept an amiable smile on his face, and swore to himself that he'd never let Midoriya think like that. 
"Nah, because you're Midoriya Deku."
His eyes watered, and he ducked his head. Covering his eyes with one hand, his chest trembled, but he didn't let out any sound. Takami wished that there was a way for him to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he would be here for him. That he would always be there for Midoriya.
Because he wanted to.

-

Midoriya trembled. He could hardly believe that this was the same Midoriya who so boldly told him to [come with me].
He flinched when a car drove by. His shoudlers were hunched and he ducked his head down so that his chin was permamently glued to his chest. Seeing him like this, thinking that, at some point in his life he was forced to be like this, made his chest boil.
"Hey," Shigaraki reached his hand out, "C'mon."
Midoriya flinched, eyes wide, and he stared at Shigaraki's hand for another, long moment.
And then, he turned around, as though to check if there was someone behind him, and Shigaraki wondered where his Izuku even came from.
"I'm talking to you, Deku," he said. "Take my hand so I don't get lost."
"W-What?"
"You know your way around here, right?" Shigaraki asked, "I don't. And I'm the type to stray so let's..." his face burned a little, but lying could be a good thing and he would do just about anything if it would make Midoriya sit up a little more. "...Let's hold hands."
He extended his hand to Midoriya.
Right when small hands reached for him (and scars that Midoriya used to hide so much weren't so well hidden. He still couldn't decide if it was a good thing that Midoriya wasn't good at hiding or angry beyond words that he was ever hurt in the first place), people around them started to point and whisper. 
His features paled and Shigaraki thought to a time, a long time ago, when he and Midoriya talked about heroes and villains. He could feel it. A tickling urge inside of him that called to bring down everyone that ever looked at Midoriya and thought that he was anything but the greatest. And if that meant ruining the world and crippling society, that was fine. 
"C'mon," he said, "Assist your elders."
And that brought a small smile on his lips.
"You're not that old," he said.
"Huh? But you're admitting that I am old?"
The young man flinched backwards, like he expected to be hit and Shigaraki swallowed his rage. Hand still extended out, he waited.
"Since now my feelings are hurt too, you'll take my hand, right?"
And Midoriya who never hesitated to make sure people weren't alone, tentatively took Shigaraki's hand. A shiver of delight ran down Shigaraki's spine, when Midoriya's lips curled into the small, shy smile. 
The rage that boiled his heart, as well as the surge of being relied on, were feelings that Shigaraki would have never experienced if Midoriya had never pulled him out of that dumpster. 
And he hoped that, the same way the smell of books now made him relax, Midoriya would take his hand without hesitation.
"I... I don't know where to go," Midoriya said quietly, "I don't... recognize any of these streets."
Shigaraki nodded back, "Since we're together, we're not lost," he said. He gave a crookcked grin, "We're on an adventure. C'mon, let's get some waffles." 
In his pocket, the phone that Midoriya bought him sat with a gps and map funciton, but he wanted this moment to stretch a little bit longer. 
But lying was a lot more fun than he thought. 

-

Chisaki knew, in his heart, that the Deku who used to eat udon with him wasn't here anymore. Instead, a timid boy with his face sat in front of him. They were not the same person.
Midoriya, who gently reminded Chisaki to eat his vegetables and taught him the wonders of dirty street vendor food, was pale-faced as he stared at the table in front of him. He went, white as a sheet, from the second Chisaki pulled his sleeves up and his tattoo shined under the light, and Chisaki wondered where this Midoriya was when they had first met.
What had happened, he wondered, between this and that Midoriya that the Midoriya he longed to see had come into existance?
Appetite gone, Chisaki wondered which stage of grief he was on. If he could finally move on from the curse that was [Midoriya Izuku] in his life. He closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose.
The sigh made the Midoriya in front of him flinch, and Chisaki didn't know that he still had room in his heart to be disappointed. 
"Could I... ask you a question?" he asked quietly.
"You already did," and then he mentally berated himself. Once upon a time, he would have jumped at the thought that Midoriya wanted to know more about him. They would have joked, would have laughed, and they would have learned more about each other and Chisaki wouldn't feel this achingly empty. He took a deep breath and shook those regrets out of his head. He felt like an idiot. "No, o ahead. Ask whatever you like."
His voice was quiet, so quiet that Chisaki would have missed his words if his body wasn't so trained to be so honed in on Midoriya's every last feature.
"Are you... okay?"
He paused, blinked.
"...What?"
The young man flushed, looking so familiar in a second that Chisaki's heart twisted in his chest, and he stared at the table.
"It's just... You're... yakuza, right? But you came alone, and you haven't demanded anything from me yet. So it can't be that you're here because you want something from me. I don't have anything to give you anyways. But you haven't walked out yet, so I must have done something to you, right? I don't know what I did, but I'm sorry for what I can't remember. I..." he placed his hand on his forehead and grimaced, like his head was throbbing, and Chisaki grabbed his wrist.
"Don't," he said. "Stop apologizing. I'm not here to hear you apologize."
"You're here for someone I'm not," he spoke so sharply that Chisaki tensed back, "For putting that look on your face, someone should apologize."
They had so many similarities. From the cautious way he inquired about his health to the way he peered up at him. The certainty of his voice when he explained that someone needed to take responsibility, and who else other that Midoriya would try to cover for something he had no control over? He could overlap the two and Chisaki wondered when he would be freed of those green eyes.
He came here, so certain that he would let go. That this wasn't His Midoriya and that he would be able to release this like a crazy, fever dream.
Instead, that blasted hope bloomed in his chest.
Midoriya lost his memories, but he didn't change at the core. Didn't that meanthat they could start over? And Chisaki could just give him beautiful memories. They could be happy.
Midoriya could choose him.
"I'm sorry I'm not him-"
"You haven't changed," Chisaki cut him off. "I would never be able to explain to you my gratitude that you are alive." And instead he did something that he didn't think that he was capable of. He dipped his head forward. "Midoriya, I'm truly glad that you're alive." He straightened up, "and since you have forgotten, allow me to remind you. My name is Chisaki Kai. I am your ally. At any point, you feel lost, you feel alone, you feel like you are not enough, I will be there for you."
"...But I'm not the person you think I am?"
Chisaki gave this laugh.
"I have found what I am looking for," he said. "Thank you for your time," he said. 
But the look of stunned shock made him feel victorious. It almost felt like, for the first time since they met, they were finally on the same playing field. 
He took a drink out of his tea, feeling like it wasn't as bitter as they usually made it.
"I have a question for you, if I may?"
And the kid in front of him, gnawing on his straw, gave a curt nod. "You already asked one."
At that, Chisaki gave a barking laugh. It was so loud that the other patrons in the store fell silent, and the man raised his hand at them to apologize. He covered his mouth and peered at Midoriya, saw Deku, and brightened.
"Yes, I suppose I did," he said when he finally managed to calm down, "May I ask some more?"
Shocked but not upset, Midoriya gave a curt nod. 
"Then," he hummed, golden eyes bright, "Could I ask why you decided to meet up with me today? You didn't look too eager."
There was a long silence, the other patrons returned to their quiet conversations, and Midoriya spoke up again. 
"I figured the faster that I disappointed you, the faster you would leave," he said. "And I..." he placed his hand over his heart, "I felt warm when I saw you."
"You know I'm a bad person, right?" Chisaki asked.
"I don't think there are any good or bad people in the world," Midoriya replied, "Just... people who hurt me and people who ignore me."
"Then, what am I to you?"
The young man gave this helpless little smile, "Chisaki-san?"
"Kai," he said, because the man he was [Overhaul] for wasn't here anymore. And until Midoriya remembered why he was [Overhaul], he'd have him call him something more intimate. 
And, since he was a bad person, he would take advantage of this. 

### sat

"You will never meet someone as gentle or as cold as him," Fuyumi said.
She stepped forward, her breath coming out in puffs by her lips as the ice coated the ground where she walked. Layers of ice laid on top of each other, each one colder and thicker than the one underneath it. They formed like sharp icicle parts, piercing through the air. The chill of death came, radiating off the ice. 
Izuku, who was merciless in his kills, often killed within a hit or less. Rei, who felt a bubbling rage from deep inside of her chest, could not claim to do the same. Not because she was particularly weak or a non-combative, but because she didn't want this man to leave the earth in such a peaceful, painless way.
This man, who whistled when their leader walked by, purred and preened and tried on several occasions to scent Izuku, did not deserve to pass away from Izuku's gentle hands. He would know fear and die praying for death. 
That, Fuyumi swore on the life Izuku saved her from.
Todorokis' know no mercy.

-

Her hands trembled. She did it. The thing that everyone, even little Kouta, had been doing since the start of all this. She had finally done it herself. Killing herself, with her quirk, was easy.
She, who had grown up wishing and praying that she was quirkless so that she would have one less thing connecting her to her family, had used her quirk to kill someone. In another time, this would have made her a vilain. A criminal. 
Here, it was normal. She was the strange one for not killing. 
And still-
A hand came to her face, and she jolted. She didn't even realize someone had come close, but her eyes found a pair of green eyes in front of her face. A small hand, calloused by hard work, cupped her face. 
Izuku.
The warmth from his hand reached from her face to her heart, thawing her out. She closed her eyes, desperately wishing that she could be worthy of this warmth. How nice would it be, if this warmth was the only thing in the world.
"...I'm... I'm okay," Fuyumi said, desperately trying to keep herself together. There was something else she needed to say. She needed to report. What, who, she killed. and her injuries. She wasn't injured. She needed to report it, because she wasn't useless. She wasn't just waiting for someone to save her. She wanted to do more than just stand by and wait for what to do and she wanted...
"Good work," Izuku spoke, his voice soft and his scent gentle. As though she wasn't shameful enough, Fuyumi felt her eyes prickle. She gave a heaving breath, her shoulders trembling. "Welcome back."
And even though it was improper and it was even more unbecoming of her, her arms wrapped around Deku. She gave a wet sob. 
What about now? Was she a little more worthy of standing next to him now? Was she worthy of his time and energy now? Was it okay that she was still alive? How much shit did Izuku have to constantly hear because he saved her? She didn't remember. 
Her hopes to be reliable seemed to fall apart, however, when small hands came to her back and rubbed circles.
Comfort wasn't the sweet smell of an unbonded omega that no longer hated her. Comfort was the smell of her leader, soaked in the blood of their enemies. 

-

[Captive: 1 man (beta) + 1 woman (beta)]
"I'm going to kill him!"
Shigaraki's voice rang in the room as he kicked the door down. Red eyes livid, he stormed into the room. Eyes immediately found the bastard that had left Kaminari in that sorry state, and he bared his teeth.
"Wait, Shigaraki!" Spinner called out, running in front of the man.
"Out of my way, Spinner!" 
But Shigaraki, who was spewing curses as he snarled and hissed, yelled out for the whole world to hear.
"Do you know what he did to Kaminari?! Did you see what he did!?" he yelled at Spinner before he turned back to their captive, "I'm going to fucking kill him!"
"No!" Spinner shouted back, grabbed Shigaraki around the middle and pushing him back. "No, you can't Shigaraki!"
"Why not!" he yelled back, "Why the fuck not!"
"Danna-sama isn't here!" the man yelled back, "Danna-sama said to keep them alive!"
At the mention of their Leader, Shigaraki stepped back, and Spinner released him. Red eyes remained trained on the stranger, lips pulled back into a deep scowl. 
"He doesn't deserve an easy way out," he spat out bitterly.
"Izuku-sama," Spinner spoke up, "Will decide that."
Shigaraki scowled, "Break his legs. At least four fingers. He doesn't need them to live."
"Is he still alive?"
The two alphas stared at each other for a moment longer before they both took a step back for the person who spoke.
Holding the door open was Endeavor, expression blank, and walking through was Izuku, arm in a sling. Shirtless with a jacket over his shoulders and thick bandages wrapping around his chest, Izuku's sweet smell immediately filled the room.
"Izuku-sama," Spinner bowed politely, and Shigaraki grumbled out some sort of greeting. Before Spinner could turn and lecture him about ettiquitte, however, Izuku brushed past them. 
He pulled a lanyard out of his sling, and dangled it.
"Wha..." the stranger peered up, no doubt stunned speechless that the Great Izuku-sama that the others spoke about was this whelp of an omega.
"What do you know about this?" he asked. 
And it was amazing, how fast a person's demeanor changed once they realized that Izuku was an omega. The man that curled in on hismelf and tried to press himself into the furthest corner of the room suddenly had this hope in his eyes. He straightened and looked at Izuku.
"You think that I'll just do whatever you want? Do you know who I am?" and the beta bared his teeth, "Know you're place!"
Which was laughable, because this little beta was severely outclassed by all three alphas in the room. 
"This little bitch-" Shigaraki's words were cut off when Izuku took a step back.
"He doesn't know anything," he said, "Do whatever you want with him."
Shigaraki's grin stretched across his face, "Anything?"
Izuku stared at him. "Kaminari can't walk on his own," he said, "Treat our guest with courtesy."
"W-Wait!" the man yelled out, "You want to know, don't you?! About that place! The pharmacy is a research center! I can tell you how to get there! D-Don't!" his eyes looked wildly between Shigaraki and the omega and then landed on Endeavor, "Endeavor-san! You're a hero! Save me!"
"Spinner, Shigaraki, good work keeping him alive all this time. Have some fun, alright?"
And Izuku walked out of the room, Endeavor left with him, never once looking back. 
Shigaraki turned to Spinner, "You wanna take the first shot?"
"Wait, wait, wait please!"
"I would be honored," the lizardman dipped his head, a grin crawling on his face as he pulled a dagger out. "We should make sure he's quiet first, right? So everyone else can rest?"
"Please, please forgive me!"
"Oh, I didn't even think about that," Shigaraki nodded, "Sounds good."
"I'll cooperate! I'll do whatever you want! I-"
"You know the problem with guys like you?" Spinner asked, "You're not even loyal to yourself. You really think that you can look at our leader like that and think that we'll let you off free? You think that you can get away with anything just because you apologized?"
The man stared up at them, all wide-eyed and fearful, and Spinner wondered how this guy managed to survive so long.

-

"Watch carefully," Izuku said, a bitter smile curling on his lips, "And find the the most opportune time to strike me down."
His throat tightened, never once expecting that he would redefine Justice in the world, and clutched his hands tightly. 
"I'm leaving the future to you."


### solo lvl

Midoriya stared at him, tilted his head, and then spoke.
"I don't have a spell for that," he said, "but I have a curse."
"A what?" Touya seemingly materialized next to him, "You can do what?"
"A hex, a curse, a debuff, whichever one you want," Midoriya replied back. He stared at Twice, "I can use [Silence]."
"...What's... the difference between the three?" Natsuo asked quietly.
Touya gave him this look, but Aizawa explained things.
"A debuff is the lightest of the three. They're usually time-locked and easiest to remove. When we enter a poison-fog and get afflicted with [poison], it's a temporary thing and only lasts a few seconds after we get out of the fog, or if someone can cast a debuff clear on us," he said. "A hex is the next step up. Concerning range and distance, it's a debuff on steroids. It's cancelled if the caster dies, or a stronger mage can break it."
He hesitated, looking at Midoriya and Midoriya spoke up.
"A curse will last past the lifetime of the Caster," he explained. "It latches onto the magic of the target. It will disappear when their magic does. It's the better option, since I can't always be next to him."
"And it also chips away at the life of the caster," Aizawa spoke up, eyes trained on Midoriya's figure.
The young man blinked at him, and smiled.
"Yes," he said. "It does."
"Then uh, don't worry about that then. // Shut this guy up!"
And Twice's hands came up to his head and shook his head.
"Shut up!" he yelled out, "Shut up! Izuku finally helped us! I'm not gonna take anything from him! // Keep speaking! I hate everyone anyways! Who cares if someone hurts-"
And his voice cut out when Midoriya's hands grabbed the back of Twice's hands. Peering up at him, green eyes met Twice's eyes, welling with frustrated tears. 
"Jin," he spoke quietly, "Do you trust me?"
The blond nodded, "but I don't wanna hurt you. // Unless you wanna get hurt."
Midoriya smiled back, looking as gentle as the petals on a flower. He tugged the taller man down a few more inches, and laid their foreheads against each other. The magic around them thickened, like a fog rolling in. A pale green lined the fog, and all the hunters in the vicinity shivered at the surge of magic that rose up. 
"Wait, Midoriya-" 
"[Silence]."

-

"...Even his [curses] are beautiful," Natsuo said, breathless. As a tanker, he had been the target of more curses than the average hunter. And still, his heart pounded at the reminder of a curse so strong it could choke out most hunters, laid out so gently at their feet. 
"And you're sure you're okay?" Aizawa asked, eyes furrowed in their worry as he followed Midoriya into the room holding a blanket.
"I-I'm fine," Midoriya replied, "I can hold those-"
"Shouldn't you rest?" the man asked, a firm frown on his face, "Aren't curses supposed to be deliberating?" 
And Natsuo didn't blame him for thinking that. Normally, curses are a last ditch, horrific thing. Something that monsters casted on their assailant, usually, as a "I'm going to die and take you with me" thing. Usually taking lifespan and magic, it was am awful thing for both the caster and the target. 
But Midoriya's cheeks were blink as he gave a shy smile to the taller man. 
"I-I'm okay," he chirped out, "Thank you for being concernered."

-

"Where did you learn how to cast [curses]?" Touya asked quietly.
"I just... knew?" Midoriya shrugged back. 
"You've... never had it casted on you before?"
Midoriya shook his head.
The taller man stared at him for a long moment before he sighed. "Okay," he said, turning his attention to his lap. "Okay, let's keep it that way."

-

"Wait," Natsuo said, lifting his hand up, "We need a name for our Guild. Before we decide and do anything else, we need to decide on what we're going to call ourselves."
There was a long pause.
"...Deku," Midoriya said, "I think we should call it Deku."
"Deku?" Natsuo frowned.
"Yeah," Midoriya lifted his finger and traced the kanji out in the air. As he wrong, the magic pulsed in the air, and the words he wrote appeared in front of him, a thick, translucent green like someone wrote in green ink with a thick brush. The casual display of strength and ability, had them staring in shock. "Not 'useless' but a Deku that 'gives it his all'," he said. 
"Sounds like backstory," Twice said. 



### APOC

"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.
