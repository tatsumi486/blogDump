There was a fire inside of him. It burned relentlessly. It never stopped. It never ebbed. There was never a reason to, and if demons were born by an emotion, and they were shackled to the earth because of it, than this [fire] was everything that Dabi was.
For that reason, he hated Midoriya.
A thin arm tightened around his waist, and he looked down at the powerless human laying next to him. He was laughably small. A tiny little thing that he could tuck under his arm and carry away.
Midoriya rubbed his forehead against his side, murmuring something or another with a happy smile.
A scarred hand came to his head, and ruffled his hair. He could set him on fire. The kid would be ash in seconds. No one would know. No one would help him. Where were his sweet heroes, running in at the nick of time to save his sorry ass. He could kill him, right now, be out before dawn.
"Dabi..." Midoriya pressed his name against the bottom of his ribcage. His lips curled up, and Dabi wondered what he was dreaming of that he could look that happy about a demon showing up in his mindscape. "...make... me a flower crown too..."
Dabi blinked. In his surprise, his brain functions came to a screeching halt as he tried to decipher the words in his head. He gave a huff, and wondered how he measured to the [Dabi] in his dreams. It would make sense, if Midoriya mistakenly thought that he was someone that wasn't him.
It would be easy. The [fire] inside him was an infinite source. As long as he lived, he would have it. Taking out one human, one that got kidnapped and tossed around as often as Midoriya did no less, would be easy. 
His hand ran through Midoriya's hair, marveling when the young man leaned into the touch.
But at the moment, it wasn't freedom that Dabi wanted.

Midoriya yawned as he sat up in his little cot. Turning his head to the side, he saw Dabi, and his tired expression.
"Gmorning," he said, rolling over on top of the taller man, he buried his face against his chest, arms and legs sprawling out on top of him.
"Get off," Dabi deadpanned.
"But you're so warm," Midoriya whined.
"I can burn you into nothing."
The young man murmured something against his chest and slowly, got up to his knees. Straddling Dabi, he looked up at him and gave a toothy grin. He leaned in to kiss him.
Back when he was younger and wanted to live more than he wanted to be free, one of the older slaves told him that [death was sweeter]. 
With Dabi's lips against his, hands roaming over the bruises he made last night, he couldn't agree more.

"Even though he's an omega?"
Don't react. He told himself. Don't react. You lose if you react. If he reacts, then it'll be proof that he cared about the things that other people called him. And he didn't care and he didn't want to care. Don't care and don't think and just move on. It doesn't mean anything because it doesn't mean anything. It's nothing.
"Izuku-chan?"
Izuku smiled. Because when you feel an unbridling amount of anger and pain, you should smile. Omegas should always smile. Because he's an omega so he should always smile. Because because because.
But before he could say anything, Shigaraki had smashed the butt of his gun to the man's head.
"Ah, sorry," he said, completely unapologetic. "I just wanted to hit something."
He didn't look at Izuku, and anyone looking at him would say that he was just an asshole. He was just a shitty human being. Shitty alpha doing shitty, alpha-like things.
And the laugh bubbled out of Izuku before he knew what he was doing.
"Do it again," he called out. 
Shigaraki, bless his heart, flipped him off and did just that. The man screamed, a pitiful sound from a pitiful person, and Izuku wished that there was a way to describe how he felt. 
For now, he just enjoyed it.

"Now that's a haunted house if I've seen any," Ingnium whistled at the sight.
"We can hold hands if you're scared," Izuku replied back.
The man whirled around, and the omega peered up at him curiously.
"...Really?" Ingenium asked, "I don't think I'll ever be scared of anything."
Izuku extended his hand out, a small smile on his face, "

-

"Why didn't anyone come to protect you?"
Izuku stared forward, not really seeing anything and gave a sardonic laugh. "They didn't have a reason to."

-

God. That smell. Izuku placed his hand over his mouth, and shivered. He leaned against the wall to try and focus on reoirentating himself instead. 
"Izuku?"
These damn alphas and their damn timing. 
At the very least, Aizawa had the decency to stand a few feet away. Why was he even here? No, that didn't matter. What did matter was that he was here at all. 
"Eraser..." Izuku rasped out, and it sounded too whiny even to his ears. But all he could see was Aizawa, the way his breathing turned labored, and that delicious looking flush crossing his features. "Eraser..." he whined out again, his knees going weak. "Please..."
His breath was knocked out of him from the force of Aizawa running at him. He gasped sharply, and Aizawa's smell, and the sudden lungful of it made his head swim, made him whimper. He wanted it. 
Aizawa, who called him Izuku. Aizawa, who got him reports whether or not he had his helmet. Aizawa, who never tried to [Command] him or anything.
His eyes watered, and briefly, he felt overwhelmed at the warmth of the man in front of him. He felt lips, slightly chapped, against his. Softly once, then twice, and then he opened his mouth and his hands grabbed his head. Aizawa slipped his leg between his, grinding up against Izuku and forcing his tongue in when the omega gasped. 
He pulled back, eyes bright and Izuku suddenly realized that he was about to take something very precious from this man. 
"Izu," Aizawa called from him like his soul was on the line. "Izuku..."
Izuku trembled, just the sound of his name on his lips was enough to make his heart pound out of his chest. Just as fast, a fear similar to when a monster was about to bite into his arm bloomed in his heart and he understood what he needed to do.
Relaxing, he lifted his hands up to cup Aizawa's head.
"Eraserhead," he murmued, "This isn't your fault."
And Aizawa, whose clear red eyes waved reports at him, purred as he leaned into the touch. Izuku gave him a smile, reached down and pulled out his gun. Without any hesitation, he twirled it around and fired it into his own gut.
The sound was deafening, but as expected, Aizawa jerked backwards. His eyes returned to normal, and his fangs receeded.
Indeed, the instinct to survive was stronger than the one to breed. And since Aizawa was a kind man at heart, he wouldn't fuck and breed a dying omega. He would be more concerned about keeping him alive.
Which worked perfectly for Izuku.
