"Deku!" Chisaki's voice echoed through the air, and none of them even realized that the man could even yell. "Deku! Come out here!"
"C-Chisaki-san!" 
"Deku!" his yells reverberated through the broken windows, sounding painfully human.

"I'm... what?"
"You haven't grown at all," the school nurse said, pursing her lips. "Your weight hasn't changed. Your height hasn't changed."
Midoriya stared back, blinking twice, and felt a dull pang in his chest.
"That's... not normal, is it?"
She hesitated, "Do you... have a special quirk?"
"I'm quirkless," he replied back without missing a beat.
She pursed her lips.
"Then, I'm not sure what this could be. Midoriya-kun, consider heading to a physician. If you want, I can recomend some paediatric dietitian that might help work with you..."
Midoriya drained the rest of the words out. Was this a scam? Something that people did to children so that their parents got involved in things? He wasn't about to introduce someone like that to prey on Deku's family when they're already a shambled mess on a good day.
"But I'm worried about you," she said. "This is the time period where kids grow the most."
A sudden wave of shame came over him. How could he ever doubt the earnesty of that gaze?
"Thank you for your concern," he said, because he was truly grateful. He was. But the concern was for the wrong person, and he had an inkling idea on what was going on. After all, if the numbers hadn't changed since he was a middle school student, wasn't it easy?
Luckily for Deku, at the very least his time had stopped. At the very least, he would return to [his] body, in that sense.

-

"I've done some digging, and I found out that you haven't changed at all," Nine said. "Isn't that interesting? Even though you're in the prime of high school. You should be shooting up like bamboo, but instead, here you are."
"H.... How did you get that information, isn't that private?"
His words were flushed as the man continued.
"No need to worry about the costs. That's all taken care of."
"that... actually makes me more worried," Midoriya replied back. If he's learned anything, when anyone in this world said not to worry, he felt like his life expectancy shorten.

-

Toyomitsu squeezed Kirishima's shoulder.
"Guys like us, who aren't attractive or smart, we only got one thing going for us."
"W...What's that?"
Toyomitsu grinned, big and bright, and Kirishima wondered how he met Midoriya, and how small Midoriya brought that large grin onto his face.
"Hard work! Don't give up, Kirishima!"
At that point, then and there, Kirishima knew what he wanted to become.

-

"Midoriya!"
Midoriya looked up and waved when Todoroki came closer. "Todoroki-kun, sorry, was I taking too long?"
The group of boys, who were so confident and certain just a second ago, took an uncertain step back.
"Oh shit, that's Todoroki," one of them muttered.
Their eyes fell to Midoriya again.
"Then... he's... Midoriya? That Midoriya?" 
"We can't win against both of them!" one of them hissed.
"W-We're sorry!" they yelled out.
"I'm not the one you should be apologizing to."
That got their attention. They were scowling and muttering, and Midoriya wonderedwhy it was so damn hard to leave people alone.
"I guess," he muttered. "S...sorry, Asada."
The boy behind him trembled a little, but didn't say anything. His eyes were trained on Midoriya's figure and Midoriya wondered why people looked so scared when they recieved assistance.
No, that's a lie. He knew why. It didn't make it any easier, but he knew why. 

### way back home deku ver

When Tamaki showed his face, no one could have seen Midoriya's reaction coming. The way his face paled and his heart mointor spiked loudly, his breaths came out in short gasps as he scooted as far back on the bed as he could as he shook his head.
Fear.
Tamaki suddenly understood that Midoriya had never forgiven him. 

-

"You don't have to forgive them," Shoto said, closing his eyes as he leaned back. "You don't have to forgive anyone you don't want to."
Midoriya picked his head up, but Shoto looked peaceful as he just enjoyed the breeze.
"You're kind," he said, "and sometimes, you're so kind that I feel like I'm the one hurting." Slowly, he opened his eyes, and turned his head to Midoriya. His lips curled into a small smile, one marred by patience and pain, and Midoriya couldn't imagine how hard his life must have been that he could look so sad when he spoke. "So you should be kind to yourself too."
"...I'm not," Midoriya said quietly, arms coming around himself tightly, "I'm not kind at all. I think that your memory of me is a beautiful person, but it's not me."
"You haven't changed a bit," Shoto replied back, certain like the sun, "as strong as you are beautiful, and as Midoriya as you always have been."

-

"But I want to move on!" Midoriya yelled out. "I don't... I don't want to be scared anymore! I don't want to-to be stuck like this! Why can't I be happy? What do I have to do to be happy?" his voice ran hoarse and he shook his head. Burying his head into his hands, he tugged at his hair. "I don't get it. I don't get it. Why did I have to live like this?"

Tamaki didn't have an answer for that, because he didn't know either. He didn't know, and the person that he always turned to for answers, Midoriya, was the one that asked this question.
"I... I'm sorry," he said.
"You're sorry?" Midoriya asked, lifting his head. "I can't... I can't go to public bathhouses, I can't go swimming at the swimming pool or the beach because, because of those words that won't heal. I can't... It's been three years and they're still fresh. They still hurt. Everything hurts, all the time, but you're sorry? You're sorry and then what? I forgive you? You're okay now? This story ends?" he asked.
Tamaki, who heard some of the others complain about how hot Midoriya looked when he never changed into summer uniforms with the rest of them, ached. All of his words felt empty. Of course they did.
"No," he said, shaking his head, "It's the start."
"but I don't want it. I don't want a story with you. so just," Midoriya shook his head, "I'll forgive you. I'll forgive you and I won't think about it ever again. S-So please, please just leave me alone."
"That's not forgiveness," Tamaki said, but his words sounded so hollow.
"Then what? You'll take more time from me?"
His heart curled in on himself. It tightened and rotted away. Facing him like this now, he realized how ignornant and naive he was from the start of this.

-

Touya wasn't Midoriya. He couldn't stop the rain. He couldn't be for Midoriya, what Midoriya was for him. It was probably a good thing, and they used to joke that one Midoriya was enough for the universe. 
But on occasion, he felt so infuriatingly annoyed with himself that he couldn't do what a middle school child could. 

-

When Touya saw him, he didn't hesitate. He sprinted to the young man in the rain, taking his jacket off to put over his head. He looked soaked, how long had he been outside?
"Deku," he said quietly, "Shit, you're freezing." 
Small hands came to his arms, feebly pushing him back, "You'll get wet..."
"I don't care about that," his voice came out sharper, and he gritted his teeth when he felt the young man tense even more. He took a deep breath, "Sorry. I didn't mean to say it like that." He hesitated, but he pushed on, "C'mon, let's get out of the rain. It's miserable out here."
And he couldn't stop the rain for Midoriya, but they could get wet together. They could run home together and they could dry off together too. It wasn't the same, but it wasn't...
Touya just hated seeing Midoriya alone. 
Leaving his jacket over Midoriya's shoulder with a small hope that he would stay warm, he extended his hand out to him. A part of him just wanted to grab his hand and lace their fingers together, run through the pouring rain while swinging their arms like maniacs, but that wasn't now.
Midoriya stared at it, his eyes watering with tears. Or maybe the rain was making it look like he was crying. It didn't really matter to Touya. He would still be here for him. 
Hesitantly, the young man took his hand. It was small in his. It was cold to the touch. Touya hoped that he would never have to let go.
"Why..." Midoriya's voice broke, taking pieces of Touya with him, "Why are you so nice to me?" His free hand, the one that Touya didn't grab, grabbed his chest and twisted the fabric right above his heart, "I... I feel like I'm going to break."
Touya's steps slowed, and he tried to find an answer that wouldn't make him sound like some psychopathic stalker. 
"...It's not easy," he said, "being nice," he clarified quickly. He squeezed Midoriya's hand tightly in his, "but I whenever I see you, I feel like it's easier than I thought. That it's not that hard, that nothing is hard. When I see you," he said, looking for those green eyes on this murky day, "I don't know. It just comes out."
"Because of the me you remember?"
He shook his head, because this he had an answer for this. Midoriya once stopped the rain for him, but next to him, that's not what Midoriya needed. He stared at him for a moment, felt happy. 
It was deplorable. It was awful, but he was happy that Midoriya was such a stick in the mud and Midoriya was so lost and so scared of the whole world.
It made Touya feel like he was important. It made Touya feel like he finally had a place in Midoriya's life, next to him. It was terrible. It was disgusting.
But Touya felt so happy.
"Because of the you in front of me, I think I finally get it," he said. "Deku, let's go home."
On top of fading hydreangea petals, Touya found Deku.

Midoriya didn't really like loud places, espcially loud places where there were so many people, but Eri's smile was radiant. 
He hated it.
Even children could move on. 
"I really like their music!" Eri cheered, her entourage of burly men in black suits located around them. "It goes BOOM and POW and it rings in my head!" 
He winced. Sounded like rock music.
"And the singer! She's really good! Her songs make me feel like I'm not alone!"
He smiled along, but then the crowd went wild and Eri clapped her hands excitedly. 
"It's starting!"
No hesitation, Mirio picked Eri up and onto his shoulders. Her eyes shined and she reached up as she screamed at the top of her lungs.
And Midoriya felt a little dizzy.
Mirio grabbed his arm then, steadying him and keeping a young girl on his shoulders without a problem. He looked forward and opened his mouth, but Midoriya couldn't make out naything that he was saying. The blond grinned back and looked toward the stage.
On the stage was a girl he felt like he should recognize.
The music started, and Midoriya didn't even realize when he started to enjoy it.

-

"It was amazing!" Midoriya said, breathless and Eri nodded next to him excitedly. 
"I love all her songs but the second song she sang-"
"Ah! The one about Spring?" Midoriya asked and Eri clapped her hands excitedly. 
"That's the one! I liked it so much! It's a song about 


### No country to fight for; no quirk to fight with
- quirkless people are born Rulers
- K style, ppl can get "bonus" for their Rulers
-> magic bonus? status buff? telepathy?
-> ofc the higher the bond, the better the bonus
- modern fantasy, certain areas have "monsters" that cannot be defeated without Ruler backing. Japan doesn't have a lot of Strong Rulers to begin with, so they've lost aobut 50% of their land to the Darkness.
- midoriya accidentally knights OFA and AFO and he hasn't caught a break since
Midoriya -> Ruler in Hiding because bad things happen to weak Rulers

-

"You have nothing to fear anymore," AFO chuckled, "For fear himself works for you, my dear Ruler."
And Midoriya's hand shot out to grab the man by the back of his shirt. He opened his mouth, about to say something, 

### withering

"You."
Midoriya almost jumped out of his skin when he realized the mountain of a man was talking to him.
"Come with me."

-

"Order whatever you want," Endeavor, and Midoriya felt like his heart would stop in his chest and he would be struck dead because Number Two Hero Endeavor sat in front of him. He wasn't in his hero-gear but it was still Number Two Hero Endeavor. 
"A-ah," Midoriya looked down at the menu, and felt his eye bulge out at the prices. It was amazing what people with salaries could afford to eat on the daily. He felt like his mind was going to explode with the sheer amount of stuff that was going on next to him. "T-Thank you, Endeavor-san-"
"Todoroki," he replied back, "I'm off-duty."
His face burned and he nodded. This man was too much for him.
"T-Thank you then, Todoroki-san." He stared at the menu and then back up, "Are... you going to get anything?"
Those blue eyes, painfully familiar in a way that Midoriya couldn't name, remained trained on him, but he didn't respond.
Why did this man ask him to this cafe, so suddenly, if he wasn't going to say anything?
The waitress came and took their order. A small pairfait (okay, look, Number Two said anything and there was no way in hell Midoriya would ever be able to afford this place again, okay? There was nothing wrong with just enjoying what little joys he could find in life) for Izuku, and a medium iced-coffee for the hero. 
The young man blinked at him, and when the waitress left, he giggled.
"I guess fire-quirk users really like their cold drinks."
And finally, that impassive stare he was given turned into something else. Midoriya didn't spend enough time with Endeavor (probably never would) to know what that expression meant, but ducked his head down.
They sat in that painful silence until their food came out. When the wait staff left them for the second time, Endeavor finally spoke up.
"You have been seen in affiliation with a man," he said, "about 180 cm. He has black hair and blue eyes. Patches of his skin is burned, and has several staples lining them."
Dabi.
"From your expression, it looks like someone came to mind. What can you tell me about him?"
Midoriya suddenly didn't want the delicious-looking parfait.
"I should have gotten something more expensive," he said. "Because either I'm a sellout for a pairfait or this is going to be my last meal."
He picked his spoon up and went for the cherry at the top first. 
"It's delicious," he said.
"Answer my question."
"I don't want to."
Endeavor narrowed his eyes.
"If... If it was because he was a bad person who did bad things, you would have come as Endeavor, right?" Midoriya asked, "and I would be in a police station being interrogated. So this... this all means something else."
"...I need to confirm something. This has nothing to do with you, so answer my question."
"If it has nothing to do with me, then you wouldn't have brought me here," Midoriya replied, gnawing his bottom lip. "Todoroki-san," he said quietly, "What are you looking for?"
The man gave this sharp sigh, his hand becoming a fist and he slammed it down on the table. "I'm trying to figure out why someone's walking around with my son's face!" Midoriya jolted, but he put his entire focus on keeping calm. Around them, the cafe fell into silence.
There was a pregnant pause, and where most people would have apologized for their outburst, Endeavor was seething in his rage and silent.
The world must look different for Number Two.



Midoriya was quiet for a moment and then spoke up.
"I don't ... really know what you're talking about," he said. "Dabi doesn't really talk about himself."
"Dabi?"
"Yeah," Midoriya said, "I don't know who you're 'Touya' is, so I can't say much about that, but my 'Dabi' isn't like that. He's a lot like you, actually. He burns brightly, you can't get close but you also can't look away."
He stared at this man, Pro-Hero Endeavor. A man who solved more cases than All Might did in any given year.
"Good luck with your... person. And thank you for keeping the streets safe, Endeavor-san," he gave a small smile, "I hope you get saved this time."
He got up from his seat and gave a polite bow.
"Please excuse me," he said, getting up. "Thank you for the tea."

-

"I thought about what you said."
Midoriya almost jumped out of his skin, why does everyone seem so fixated on sending him into cardiac arrest.
"What did you mean? [I hope you get saved this time.]"
"I-It's just," Midoiya stuttered and stammered. "I just.. You, you look like you wanted to be saved."
That was the wrong thing to say, because the fire lit across his features. 
"Do you know who I am, boy? I am Endeavor! I am the one that does the saving! What, do you think that you could save me!?"
"Of course not!" Midoriya squeaked out, "But you, when you spoke about Touya, you didn't look happy either. You didn't... You didn't look like you really wanted to meet him."
"Of course I want to see him again! Of course I want to-"
"...Todoroki-san," Midoriya said quietly, eyebrows pinched in concern as he took a step forward, "I... I don't think you should be here right now. Do you-do you have someone you can contact? Someone that, uh, knows about the current situation? Maybe someone you can confide in? A drinking buddy? A friend?"
"Are you mocking me?" the man hissed out, and Midoriya jolted again. His massive hand came and grabbed his wrist. "Look at me. When has Endeavor ever been alone?"
And that smell came.
Oh, Todoroki-san was drunk. That's why he was like this. 
Green eyes softened, because if drinking really did release a person's inhibitions, he wondered if the only time Endeavor could ask for help was when he was uninhibited. The thought made him feel lonely.
He grabbed the man's hand and squeezed. His hand was so pathetically small, but the thought that he could abandon this man and run off never occured to him.
"Then, Todoroki-san, will you please stay with me?" he asked, "I'm scared of being alone," he lied.
And to lie about needing to be saved would be a new low for Midoriya, who had no attachment to life. 
But Endeavor's eyes focused on him, and he wondered if Todoroki-san could use a break.
