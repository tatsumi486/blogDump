"You almost got caught," Stain hissed out, grabbing his arm.
But Deku wasn't looking at him. Staring out at the street for another moment, he turned back with stars in his eyes.
"Did you see that? The look on her face when he caught her?" He was glowing as he bounced on his heels. The entire night sky could fit into his eyes as he beamed up at Stain. "Gosh, she looked so happy!"
The older man, more than used to these antics, gave a long sigh. A hand came up to his eye, where it was already swelling, and Deku hissed at the touch.
"Let's go," he said. 
"But this is my favorite part..." Deku whined, stomping his feet a little. 
But Stain wasn't Dabi, so he remained firm in his response. 
"Let's go." His hands tightened around his wrist, and Deku winced.
"Fine, you brute," he sighed. He threw one last, longing gaze to the scene of the crime, and his expression melted into a happy smile. "Good has been done today."

"Step back, Deku," Stain said, his blade drawn. "Don't think that I won't cut you down," he hissed. 
"We got after those that heroes can't," Deku reminded him, like he needed a reminder.
"Like the one behind you."
The lizardboy quailed, and Deku remained firm in his stance in front of him. "Like someone who is a danger to society," he said.
"He was about to commit a crime."
"But he hasn't."
Stain bared his teeth, "You understand that he wasn't about to show you mercy, right? He wasn't going to show you kindness! He was going to hurt you, Deku!"
Deku resolutely shook his head.
"But he didn't."
And the part of Deku he hated the most was the part that he liked the most about him.

"Can someone quirkless become a hero?" the man repeated and then laughed, "Of course not!"
He stood over Akakuro, eyes so bright they were glowing, and Akakuro glared up at him.
"But to rule the world, you don't need a quirk," the man continued. "Isn't that funny?"

"...Izuku, you've been coming onto me on a schedule, haven't you?"
It was something that Hawks realized quickly, but didn't want to recognize. 
Green eyes flitted from his chest to his eyes, and he leaned in to kiss him, but Hawks turned his head away. Hands coming to his hips, he narrowed his eyes.
"Please answer me."
Izuku leaned back with an annoyed sigh. "Does it matter?"
"Yes," Hawks said, "because it's not a shchedule that we decided. It's an arbitrary schedule that you came up with on your own. Once every four days between three and dinner."
"Sounds like you have an answer-"
"Izuku," Hawks' hands came to his hips and squeezed. "Why?"
There was a brief silence, and the blond honestly thought that Izuku would get off of him and just leave, and Hawks wouldn't hear his voice for weeks again when Izuku finally spoke up.
"Isn't it bad for you to be pent-up?" he asked. 
"Pent... pent-up?"
Izuku nodded. "Don't mated alphas need to be..." his face darkened just a bit, a soft blush that would have normally set Hawks' heart aflutter, "...need to have sex every few days or else they suffer serious health consequences?"
Hawks' jaw unhinged. He stared at him and then took a deep breath as he rode out a swell of disappointment. It wasn't because Izuku wanted him. Of course not.
"No, that's not true at all."
"But you've been doing better," Izuku replied back, and Hawks wasn't shocked that he kept tabs on his performance. It made a lot more sense, if Izuku had connected this together and just figured that this was the best thing to do. 
The blond clenched his jaw tightly. He felt so fucking stupid.
"It's not because of the sex."
The look Izuku gave him for that response spoke measures.
"I'm sure," the young man replied back. "Look, if you know, then it'll be easier. Let's get this over with." He reached for Hawks' pants, ready to unbuckle them and get the show on the road, when Hawks' hands came to his.
"I... I don't think this is a good idea."
"You were fine with it four days ago."
"That's because I didn't know-"
Izuku's hands came up to cup his face. He lined their noses together, and rested their foreheads together. 
"That's fine, isn't it?" he asked. "You didn't know earlier and you were happier. Isn't that better?"
And suddenly, it wasn't just about this. A cold fear settled into the pit of Hawks' gut, and he was reminded of Izuku, leaning against the side of the wall, blood pooling on the ground, but never reporting what he saw downstairs.
"You..."
This was no longer about him and his personal feelings. His hands grabbed Izuku by the shoulders, feeling how thin he was, and he grimaced when the young man dropped his arms and closed his eyes. Hawks wasn't, wouldn't...
"That scares me," he said. 
Izuku opened his eyes, confused. It made Hawks choke.
"Doesn't that just mean you're shouldering all that by yourself?" he asked. "I don't... I know that, given how we bonded, you don't think this as anything but a nessesity, but I... I do care about you. This isn't about being bonded or anything. Me, I, care about you."
He covered his face.
"It sounds insincere, right? After all, I've never done anything for you. And every time I feel like I've taken a step closer to you, something like this happens and I feel like I'm back there, flying blind in the night."
His wings droooped pathetically behind him. The sight of it made Izuku's heart clench.
"...I didn't do it to make you feel bad," Izuku said. "I... You looked happy, these last couple of weeks. So I thought it didn't matter-"
"Of course it matters!"
Hawks voice was sharp. His gaze cut right to Izuku's eyes, silencing him in a second before he spoke much more softly.
"Of course, it matters. There's nothing about you that doesn't matter to me. Midoriya, if you don't want this, we don't have to do this."
"But you-"
"No, not about me. You've done more than enough for me," the blond said, shaking his head. "I will be fine without it. I... I don't want to be a burden to you."
"If this helps you out, I won't oppose it," Izuku said. "I don't particularly like or hate it. Doing it or not doesn't mean anything to me."
Which was apparently the wrong thing to say, because the blond looked like he was knived.
"It... doesn't mean anything, huh?" he said. He ran his hand through his hair. "Izuku, one day, it might mean something to you. And I'm so scared what would happen to you at that time."
"...If you're still there," Izuku gave him a small smile, "then, at that time, I'll be fine. I'm sure you'll take care of me."
The former hero dropped his hands into his lap, eyes wide and he gave a breathless laugh.
"Yeah?"
"I don't really get it, but you're looking after me, right?" he asked. "Then it's fine. I don't mind."
Hawks wasn't having it. His arms wrapped around the young man and pulled him in close.
"I know," he said. "I know you don't."
Hawks didn't budge otherwise. 

### kind nightmare

"Ara?"
Midoriya felt a chill run down his back when he felt a hand come around his neck.
"My oh my, does UA know that their wayward freshman is out buying condoms in the middle of the night?"
Hot tears welled in his tears.

"I'll give it to you," Shigaraki said, "you want to know where Sensei is, right? But you know, I want something in return. Nothing in the world is free, right?"
"Name it."
Tsukauchi shot Yagi a harsh look. 
"Lemme live quietly. I odn't care if it's under survailance or what, but I wanna do this whole 'good, clean, civilian life'."
It sounded too good to be true.
"Why?"
"Hm..." Shigaraki tilted his head left and right, "I wanted to see what he meant."
"...What?"
"So, deal or no deal?"
"...You'll have to come with me," Tsukauchi replied back. 
"Sure, be gentle with me and I'll play along. How does that sound?"
The pair looked at him, distrusting. 

-

"Here."
Midoriya looked from the bag in Aizawa's hand to the man's face and then back to the bag. His teacher wouldn't meet his eyes, and his cheeks darkened.
"Are you going to take it or not?"
"R-right," Midoriya lifted his hands up, almost robotically, and took the bag. "T-Thank you very much."
"Don't be so stiff," his homeroom teacher sighed. His arms crossed over his chest. "Well? Open it."
"R-Right," Midoriya opened the bag and he reached through the tissue paper to pull a mug out. Upon closer inspection, he realized that there were two mugs. Big mugs that would need both of his hands to hold. The cup part was a milky white with the top looking like the top looking like a tuxedo cat, and the handle was modeled to look like a black tail. He looked back up at his teacher.
"I say it's a gift, but it's for me to use when I come over," he said, his cheeks darkening. "You... understand what I mean when I say that, right?"
Midoriya's brain racked for an answer.
"T-Thank you very much," he said, giving a polite bow. "I-I'll go prepare some coffee-"
"Close, but that's not all."
Aizawa stepped closer, his hands coming around Midoriya's hand around the cup as he leaned his head close enough for their noses to bumb into each other. Midoriya's heart hammered in his chest. Could his teacher hear it, and that's why his smile grew so much?
"It means that I plan on being here more often." 
"O-Oh," Midoriya replied back. "I-Is that good?"
The older man took a step back, a frown on his face. "Apparently not."
"W-wait, I-I was just, uhm, surprised. I-I can be, uhm, really happy."
"It wasn't a pop quiz."
"Eh?"
Aizawa ran his han through his hair, before he rested it on the back of his neck. He turned around.
"It's nothing, nevermind. I hope you like the cups."

-

"And he just left like that?"
Midoriya nodded.
Hawks sucked on his straw. "Nee, Izuku, if I told you that I wanted to tie you up  and cut you with my feathers the next time we fucked, would you?"
The look on Midoriya's face said no, but he nodded his head.
"I... Okay," he said, 
"See? That's the problem."
"Hm?" 
"You're just agreeing to whatever we want, right? Whatever to make us happy," he asked, "That's not what he wants. He wants you to be happy of your own accord. Does that make sense?"
"Then, what should I do?"
The blond stared at him, and laughed. "Just stay with me. If he's unsatisfied with what he's got, then he needs to move on." He tilted his head, and hummed, "But I'm a little jealous."
"R-Really?" Midoriya looked up and then tilted his head, and came to the wrong conclusion as he passed his drink up, "I drank some of it, but you can have some."
Hawks stared at him for a long moment before he covered his face and laughed. 
"Nah, it's nothing like that," he said. He reached over and wrapped his arm around Midoriya's shoulder, and pulled a wing over them when he kissed him. "Something like this, you know?"
Midoriya's face flushed and he brought his gaze down, "Th-that's..."
"What's the matter?" the blond murmured, chasing his face to nibble on his bottom lip.
"We-we're outside," Midoriya whispered.
"Yep," Hawks' eyes shined, "Isn't it exciting?"
Midoriya gnawed on is bottom lip, and it was too cute for Hawks not to kiss. He leaned in, licking his lips and humming in delight when Midoriya leaned into the touch. As awful as it was, maybe it would be better if

"Here it is," Midoriya said, dropping a giant duffel bag on top of the coffee table. "I have another one in the back."
Dabi stared, dumbfounded. 
"You... kept all of it?"
"I'm not going to spend money you got taking from poeple like me."
"People like you?"
"Weaklings."
Dabi arched an eyebrow, "You're a lot of things, sweetheart, but weakling isn't one of them."
Midoriya shook his head. 
"Your money is all there. I didn't spent any of it," he said. "You can take it back."
"It could be clean," Dabi tried. 
"Clean money doesn't come in bags like this."
The man scowled back. "Money is money."
"Then, take it back. It's yours anyways."
"Why didn't you spend it?"
"It's not mine."
"Money is money," he repeated.
And Midoriya shook his head again. 
A frown started to stretch his face as he got up from his seat. Wary green eyes watched him, and he backed up as Dabi's long legs closed the distance between them. His back hit the wall and Dabi's hand grabbed his shoulder, pinning him there. 
"Your electricity got cut again, didn't it?" he asked. "Isn't your water next? Can an aspiring hero really live like this?" His other hand came up to cup his face, "Do your beloved teachers know that you live like this?"
"It's... not somehting they have to worry about."
"What does that make me then? If I'm worried about you?"
Midoriya stilled. 
"You... You what?"
Dabi leaned forward, close enough that their nose touched and Midoriya almost went crossed-eyed looking at him.
"Hah... You should see the look on your face," he said, taking a step back and turning around. He grabbed the duffel bag and slung it over his shoulder. "Later."
And it was habit really, when someone went to his entrance way and maybe Midoriya was just as lonely as he was stupid, because he opened his big mouth and said, "Stay safe."
Dabi's hand stilled on the doorknob. 
"Yeah, whatever," and he was gone.
After he left, Midoriya realized that he should have leveled up before he left. He sighed, and rubbed the back of his neck. Shit. It was probably too late to run after him and use an item, wasn't it? He checked the time on his phone. 
Kan-sensei said that he was taking his dog to the vet, Aizawa-sensei was doing patrols, Shigaraki was... he didn't know. He assumed something illegal, and prayed that it was just loitering or something.
