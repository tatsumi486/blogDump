### Way Back Home

"Akakuro."
Red eyes looked up to where Iida tapped his desk. The man looked back at him, bags under his eyes and exhausted.
"Can you stay a few extra hours? There was a huge crash-"
-and it would be faster for everyone to put in one or two extra hours to help with the reports instead of dumping all of it to one person to stay here until morning light. Well, he said that, but it would probably just be him, Iida, and whoever the original officers were, until they could all leave.
"No problem," Akakuro replied, "Lemme make a call." He got up and pulled his phone out. 
"Oh, then ask Midoriya if he wants us to pick u anything on our way back to his place."
Akakuro scowled.
"Aw, don't be like that, you sourwuss," Iida said, waving his hand, "My little brother is studying with him tonight."
And without really thinking about it, the words slipped past Akakuro's lips.
"God, there's two of you?"
There was a brief second before the entire floor broke into fits of laughter.

-

Midoriya stiffled a laugh, proably because he also couldn't imagine Akakuro brightening anything up, but the sight of his wide grin had his chest loosening up.
"It was so annoying," Akakuro said, all of his previous grievances lost to the wind. "If they just put a fraction of their energy eavesdropping, maybe we would have all gone home on time."
"Speaking of going home," Dabi called out, towel around his neck, "Bathroom's free."
Akakuro stood up. "Yeah, thanks."
The younger man waved it off. Blue eyes fixed on Midoriya, "Don't stay up too long babbling."
"It's not babbling," the young man replied back weakly. 
A smile stretched across Dabi's face, walking forward to ruffle his hair. "Yeah, yeah." He dropped down next to the man, a book in his hand as he opened to finish the chapter before he headed in for the night. 
"Hey, Stain, eat all your damn carrots tomorrow!" Shigaraki yelled from the kitchen.
Akakuro scowled in return as he rushed into the bathroom to avoid that confrontation. As the door closed behind him, Shigaraki came running out, serving spoon in hand.
"Damn that bastard," Shigaraki pointed at Dabi, "and stop leaving your green peppers behind."
Dabi rolled his eyes.
"Izuku, don't grow up to be like these, food-wasting assholes," he said before turning back around to pack their lunches for the next day. 
Akakuro sighed deeply as he got ready for a shower. Shigaraki was way too damn loud if he could hear him in the bathroom. With a hum, he rolled his shoulders, and didn't realize that he was smiling till he caught his reflection in the mirror. 

-

Chiskai pinched the bridge of his nose.
"Explain."
"Y-You look like you weren't having a good day!" Setsuno chirpped up. 
"A-And we thought that you would like a... a pick-me-up for the day," Hojo said, probably starting to realize the weight of the issue. 
"You frequent that host club, so we figured that you wanted... one..." Tabe said quietly, shrinking at the terryfyingly blank expression on their boss's face.
"Ta-da!" Setsuno said, motioning to Midoriya.
Midoriya, who was tied up and gagged on his office floor, looked up at him. Bright green eyes, full of confusion, stared up at him. Chisaki took a deep breath in.
"Everyone out. Don't do this again."
He kneeled down in front of Midoriya, and with a quick use of his quirk, had him freed.
"What happened?"
"I.. I'm not sure," Midoriya said.
"Why didn't you fight back?"
"Ah, I figured that it wasn't that bad?"
"Yakuza kiddnapping you isn't that bad?" Chisaki asked, arching his eyebrow. Come to think of it, he supposed that on Midoriya's extremely skewed view on the world, it probably didn't even come to Top 100 bad things that happened to him this week. The headache he had from before built back up.
"Well, they were your guys," Midoriya said, "And they even said that they didn't want to hurt me."
"You ever considered that they might be lying?"
The young man laughed back.
"No way, you like honest guys."
And just as fast, the headache was replaced by something else entirely. 
"Well, since you're here, I might as well as feed you. Let's get something to eat."
"Ah," Midoriya patted himself down, "I don't know where my bag is."
"I'll tell them to get it for you. C'mon, you like yakitori, right?"
"Eh?" Midoriya blinked. "Uh, yeah I guess."
And he didn't need to know that Kurono and Mina were mutuals on Instagram, so Chisaki knew that he had ramen two days ago and crepes last Friday. From the sounds of it, Midoriya didn't really have any social media. Or did and he never used it. 
"Then, let's go." He said, grabbing his jacket and pulling the door open. Midoriya scurried on out, still confused and Chisaki waved at his men, "Go get lunch."
He pretended not to hear them cheering as soon as the door shut behind them.
"I'm glad they're so energetic," Midoriya said as they walked down the stairs.
"That makes one of us," Chisaki replied dryly. He paused, golden eyes taking in the young man underneath the sunlight. "You don't look so well. Have you been sleeping?" His fingers twitched to touch those cheeks, run the back of his fingers against the bags under his eyes, and ultimately placed his hands in his pockets instead. 
"Ah, school's been getting busy," Midoriya said, shrugging his shoulders like Chisaki was blind and he couldn't see that one shoulder wasn't moving as high as the other, "You know how it is."
Indeed, Chisaki thought, feeling a hole open up from inside. He had no idea.
"Hm, then I suppose I should encourage them to kidnap you more often," he said. When Midoriya whipped around, wide-eyed, he managed a smile. "It's nice to see you, regardless of circumstances."
He scoffed back, and who else would scoff so brazenly at Chisaki like this, as sighed.
"I think there's better ways to catch my attention."
"You refused the dress."
"There are more than two ways."
And without meaning to, Chisaki laughed. A rich sound that reverberated between the two of them. 

-

"Wow, you even got yakuza wrapped around your finger," Chimera said as he stepped out of the alleyway. "So, why are you still working?"
"Because I need money?"
At that, Chimera tossed a duffel bag at him. It hit Midoriya straight in the chest and nearly toppled him over. Barely managing to catch it in his arms, he gave a wheeze as he readusted his steps. 
"What..."
"It's about a million yen in there."
Midoriya's jaw dropped.
"W-What?"
"It should be enough for you to live in peace for a bit. I'll come back with more in about a week-"
"I don't want this!" Midoriya said, his voice climbing so high up in pitch that it was almost inaudiable. He tried to push the bag back, but the older man took a step further into the alleyway. "What the hell am I going to do with all of this anyways?"


### SAT

Being bit by an infected human was different than being bit by an actual monster. Kneeling down next to Enji, he placed his bare forearm in front of the alpha. Pupils like slits, snarling and growling as he struggled against airwhips, Midoriya was immensely grateful that they were the only ones here, and that he was finally strong neough to protect someone.
Enji sank his teeth into the meat of Midoriya's arm. The bone crunched underneath his maw, and blood came dribbling down his chin. The pain was bearable, but unmistakably, Midoriya's veins turned black against his skin.
And slowly, as though the poison was leaving Enji's body, from his teeth to Midoriya's arm, his jaw relaxed. Eyes looking more human than a beast, he unhinged his jaw.
The realization hit him then, and Midoriya pitied him. If Enji had been any weaker, he would have just passed out, and all of this would have been a bad dream. At the same time, they were lucky that Enji was so strong, he took a step back. Pulling Air Whip off of him, he looked at Enji.
"Are you back?" he asked, pulling his injured arm behind him. "I can buy you ten minutes. Get on your feet-"
"Izuku, what did you do?"
Midoriya stared at him for a moment longer. He had his fair share of bites, so he knew what was going on. Heavy fever, nausea, standard things that happened to someone when an infection came in. Terrible nightmares and pain were things that was more common than laughing for him. So, he was fine.
And more than anything, he didn't want to watch Enji suffer from something he didn't have to.
"Nothing," Midoriya replied back. Knocking him out would have been for best for him, but there was nothing he could do about it at the moment. He didn't think that Enji would actually be this durable. "Nothing happened."
Enji touched the blood on his chin, blue eyes blazing with a growing about of frustration, "You expect me to believe that?"
"I hope you do," Midoriya replied back, "It'll be easier for you."
Enji, who recovered much faster than Midoriya expected him to, got up to his feet and rushed at him. Grabbing him by the shoulder, a tight and unrelenting grip that sent shivers down Midoriya's back, he pushed until Midoriya's body was facing his. 
"And you?" he asked, "Would me playing ignorant be easier for you?"
Green eyes stared at him, his gaze starting to get hazy and unfocused. His breathing was starting to get ragged, and he was suddenly hit by how good Enji smelled, even with his blood smeared around his mouth. He flustered, but one the thought permeated into his mind, it refused to leave.
"Y-Yes," Midoriya stammered out, feeling as though he was losing himself. He nodded his head several times. "Yes, it would-"
"But it's not easy for me. It hasn't gotten any easier for me. Every day, I feel as though it's getting harder and harder for me to-"
Don't say it, Midoriya wanted to beg.
"-to pretend that I don't care."
More than anything else in the world, Midoriya never wanted to matter to the people who mattered to him. This went beyond a hero-saving-civilian, or an alpha-with-omega. It was Enji, who wanted to see Midoriya tomorrow, the day after, the week after, because he had grown to enjoy his shitty company and appreciate his life.
"Izuku, you aren't alone. You aren't alone, because you make me feel like I'm not alone."
And Midoriya's broken arm would be proof of that.
"I-I can't-" Midoriya tried, losing feeling in his body. 
"That's fine," Enji replied, sounding so reliable and strong in just two words. "I won't leave you."
It's because it had been a long while. It's because of this incomprehensible heat. It was because he was weakening quickly by the second. Yes, these were all plausible reasons for why Midoriya closed his eyes and pressed his lips against Enji's mouth.
Blood smeared across his palette. A growl ripped from his throat, resonating all the way down to his groin, as massive hands came up to his hips and back.
"I will not lose myself," Enji said, even though his pupils were dialating. "I do not want to hurt you," his voice cracked. A hand came to hover at Midoriya's broken arm, "not anymore."
"You can't hurt me," Midoriya replied, a laugh on his lips. He placed his uninjured hand on Enji's forehead. "Don't worry about that."

-

Midoriya woke up slowly, eyes opening as he yawned. Pain shot up and down his arm, but when he looked at it, his casted arm was still connected to his body. He looked around, the infirmary then.
"You're awake," Chisaki noted as he walked in. He closed the door behind him, locking it and then moved to close the window. "Good. Answer me, what the hell did you do?"
"How long was I asleep?"
"...Six hours," Chisaki replied, "Now answer me."
Midoriya looked at Chisaki and motioned him to come closer. The older man gave a long-suffering sigh, but did so. Taking a seat on an uncomfortable-looking stool, he sat down next to Midoriya's bedside. The young man motioned for him to come even closer. A growing frown on his face, Chisaki leaned in a little more.
"This better be worth it-" he cut himself off when Midoriya leaned in and took a deep whiff of his neck. Face flushing, Chisaki shoved himself backwards. Almost flying out of his seat, his stool clattered to the ground as he placed his hand on his scent gland and stared at Midoriya in shock. He wasn't some desperate and pining alpha, but the unexpected and intimate gesture had his entire body shaking. Teeth sharpened under his mask, because for an omega to be so brazen to smell him-for Midoriya to show any semblance of interest in him-
"It'll be better in another ten hours," Midoriya's voice came back. 
"W-what kind of test was that?!" Chisaki snapped back, his emotions whipping out by lacing his voice with frustration.
"Enji got bit by a monster, not an infected," Midoriya said, living his arm up. "I killed the monster, but Enji wasn't himself. So I made him bite," he lifted his casted arm. "Standard, fever, delirium, and for a moment," he hesistated, looking at Chisaki before a rosy blush came onto his cheeks, "I think about how nice alphas smell."
There was a long pause.
"Is there something I could do to... alleviate those symptoms?"
Midoriya arched an eyebrow, and without meaning to, raked his eyes down Chisaki's figure. His cheeks started to burn, and suddenly, he felt parched.
"I'm glad that, at the very least, the thought doesn't disgust you,' Chisaki said, unmoving from where he stood. Taking purposeful steps, he slowly closed the space between them again. Long fingers unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt, revealing more of his colarbone and neck.
He stopped there, standing next to the bed. Molten gold eyes stared at Midoriya, failing to look as unaffected and unbothered as he usually did.
"What can I do for you?" he asked, "I am at your disposal."
"I don't... want to take advantage of you," the younger man said, a heat bundling inside of him. "And I don't want to do something you'll regret."
A large hand laid on Midoriya's, on top of the bedsheets in the infimrmay.
"My regret stems from any moment I spend without you," Chisaki said, raising his hand to rest on Midoriya's broken arm. "But that's something I can live with. I can live with regrets."
Midoriya looked up, and Chisaki's expression twisted into something he rarely saw. Eyebrows pinched, he placed his head down onto Midoriya's thin shoulder.
"I can live without you, but I pray that you wouldn't condemn me to that."
Small fingers came up to wrap around Chisaki's back. It barely made it to his back, given how small he was and their awkward angle, but this warmth would haunt Chisaki's dreams for a long time afterwards.
The sweet smell wafted into his nose, and he tried not to inhale too sharply. It swirled in his chest like a vortex, squeezing his organs tightly.
"Chisaki," Midoriya whispered on his exhale, sounding beautiful and breathles. 
The older man pulled back, face flushed.
"I want you, but I don't want it unless you're in the right state of mind. So, I," he hesitated, before he leaned in to kiss Midoriya. He probably wanted to say something else, when a moan pulled out of Midoriya instead. 
The younger flushed harder, his shoulders starting to tremble.
"...You're not making this easier for me," Chisaki said, his pupils turning to slits. 
"Does that mean you'll make it easier for me?"
The older man clenched his jaw tightly before he sighed. 
"Lean back," he said, "And leave everything to me."

-

The problem with being injured was that Midoriya felt like his inner clock completely restarted. He woke up when the sun was high in the sky, right before noon. His head was pounding, like someone was tightening his skull to be too tight on his head, and he sighed. He slept way too much. Rubbing the back of his neck, he swung his legs over the bed.
He placed his hand on Twice's chest and gently shook him. The blond muttered and rolled over.
"Noooo... I don't wanna wake up..." he muttered.
"I'm leaving," Midoriya said.
"That's why..." he whined. With a deep sigh, he sat up. "See, that's what I mean, Izuku. I never get to sleep with you."
The young man stared for another moment, before he leaned in to press a chaste kiss against his lips.
"Good morning," he tried again.
"Okay, you got me," Twice sighed. "//Don't think that'll work forever!"
The effects must not have completely worn off, since Twice smelled as delectable as he did the day before. Midoriya would have to be careful not to stand too closely to anyone. With that in mind, he tried to change his clothes, when a hand came to his shoulde.r
"Hey, lemme help you. Buttons are a bitch when you got one hand. // I don't wanna help you!"
"Thanks," Midoriya said, too tired to fight it off.
He wouldn't know, but that single word, the fact that Midoriya was allowing Twice to help him, was enough to have Twice grinning from ear-to-ear for the rest of the day.


### Apoc

Deku took four steps into the corridor. Normally, at this time of the morning, it was quiet. The wee hours of the morning before sunlight  traced the horizon, where Deku made his way to leave for morning patrol.
Kouta, his roommate and equally light-sleeper, usually gets up with him. From his understanding, the young boy would spend his time helping out the morning cooking duties or whatever. 
"Morning, Deku."
With an easy grin, Hawks came and joined him.
"Looks like it's going to be clear skies for the day," he reported. 
Deku nodded back. 
Kouta's voice carried down the hallway, spurring Deku to move directly to the sound. The closer they got to the source of the sound, the more distinct his words became. Their steps never hastened, even as the words echoed through the corridor. 
"I don't want to!" Kouta's voice rang out. "I don't want to like you! I'm sick of liking people! You're all going to just die and leave me anyways! So just go away!"
It was a fair assessment from a child, who had lost everything and then some in the world. It didn't make it any easier for people to listen to. 
Fuyumi, eyes rimmed red from unshed tears, stared at him, as patiently as she could.
Both expressions of differing types of despair fell onto Deku as he walked in.
"Deku!" Fuyumi cried out, hastily wiping at her eyes, "I-I uhm-"
"Deku!" Kouta cut her off, running to the older man. "I'm ready to go!"
"But it's..." her voice trailed, "It's dangerous."
And Hawks suddenly understood what had probably happened that led up to this. The blond turned to their small leader, and wndered what he was going to do. There had been continuous objection to having Kouta come along with the supply groups as it was, but Deku hadn't made any changes.
Fuyumi, who hasn't stepped off the compound since her arrival, was the natural opposite to Kouta, who left at every opportunity. 
"W-wait, Deku, please. Don't you... Don't you think so too? That it's dangerous out there? It's too dangerous for a child like Kouta to-"
Hawks could feel Kouta bristle from where he was, but before he could intervene, Deku actually spoke up.
"It's dangerous here too," he said, saying exactly the opposite of what any sensible person should have said, and definately the opposite of what Fuyumi wanted to hear. "Everyone is doing what they can. And this is what Kouta chose."
Fuyumi's face fell. "Deku, you..."
"He's not leaving to die. He's not living to die," Deku continued.
Kouta's small hand gripped Deku's pant let tightly. While Hawks understood both sides of the arguement, he was going to side with Deku. He's seen him in the field. If he doesn't want Kouta to see blood, Kouta will not see blood.
And, he was once Kouta, lost without anything but an extended hand asking him if he'd like to be a hero. If anything, Kouta was lucky. In this kind of world, he had something to latch onto. 
"We're leaving."
But he hated how this adjusted the target onto Midoriya's back instead.

-

It was, in theory, simple. Use his airwhip to grab the two of them, he would shoot out of the vehicle with super-strength, find some balance, and float on down. Easy. A manuveur that he's done before, a hundred times before. 
Kouta tucked under his chin, he ejected the two of them out of the vehicle. His knees goraned and creeked in protest, but he paid it no mind. As long as they still work, he didn't care. The door swung open, at least he didn't have to break through it, and with glass shards falling like raindrops around them, Deku and Kouta were airbourne. 
Float, he tried.
Float.
Airwhip, probably since he lost feeling in his arms, wasn't responding either. For a brief instant, he thought that he was actually still in the car, instead of faling. The sensation of falling slowed down tremendously. 
It was such a sudden thought, but he realized that Kouta's grown a lot. In a little bit, he was going to outgrow Deku, wasn't he? It would be nice, if he was alive to see that.
-
"I got you!"
Jerked out of the air and landing safely on the ground, Hawks gently placed them on the ground. Eyes wide, his hand came to Deku's side. Kouta was out, but he was responsive. 
"Shit," he whispered. A hand reached for his walkie, "Hawks reporting, get the medbay ready. Repeat, get the medbay-"
Deku's hand came to Hawks' hand, eyes sharp as he sat up. When he opened his mouth, black blood dribbled out of his mouth and Hawks almost recoiled.
"It's not over yet," Deku said, looking beyond Hawks to the monster. "G-Get Kouta-"
"We go together," Hawks cut him off, hand on his shoulder and eyes certain. This was the one thing he wouldn't budge on. "Wherever that is."
The look in Deku's eyes, in green eyes so clear that Hawks could see his reflection, was so bright that the blond felt his heart tear a little.
No doubt, Deku was too far injured and the thinking part of his brain had taken a hit, because instead of brushing off Hawks like he normally did, he gave this wide grin. In an instant, he looked like a young kid and not the battle-battered leader that Hawks entrusted his life to.
"You should... value your life more."
If his life could make Deku smile like that, then Hawks just might.
"Don't take the fun all for yourself, Deku!"
And here came Rappa. With a pointed look, Deku relaxed into Hawks' grip.
"Ready now?" the blond asked, cradling his head against his chest as his feathers scured Kouta. Was it a miracle that they were both so small that he could carry them easily, or a pity? "Let's go home."
"Keigo," Deku whispered, right against his colarbone as they took off. "Thank you."
"Anywhere you are," Hawks muttered, "I'll come flying."


### rotting flowers

A shudder raked down Midoriya's back as he slept. Next to him, Hawks stared at him, his flushed features, the way his robe parted just the slightest bit... and pulled the covers up a little more for him. It would be inappropiate to interupt his slumber for his primal desires. Raising a hand to Midoriya's forehead, he felt relieved to know that he didn't have a fever.
Who would have thought his heart would melt so easily in the hands of the Empire's Rotting Flower? 
"Nnna, Toshinori?"
"Wrong blond," he replied. 
Midoriya's eyes snapped open and he jerked up into a sitting position. His hands yanked his blanket up to cover his chest. The blond blinked at him, the flurry of movements catching him off guard.
"H-Hawks," he gasped, face flushed, "I-I'm, I'm not-Oh god, did I drool?" He dropped the blanket on his lap to cover his face with his arms, "Oh no..."
And Hawks laughed in response, a bright sound that reverbrated between them.
"Don't mind me," he said, getting off his bed, "I was just checking if you had a fever."
"No, that's tomorrow."
The blond froze mid-stretch. Wings folding behind him, he turned back around to pierce Midoriya with a long stare.
"Pardon?"
Midoriya covered his mouth with his hand, "Uh. I mean... Oh, I guess I'm more tired than I thought I... I thought that you meant that I would have the-the-" green eyes darted around the bed as his voice picked up in pitch and frequency, "the-meeting tomorrow, yeah! I don't know how my brain auto-corrected that, the human mind is a strange thing-"
Hawks reached for his face, cupping the soft cheeks in his hands, and felt Midoriya's jaw click shut. Waiting until green eyes locked with his, he asked very quietly.
"I think you meant what you said."
"It's not..." Midoriya looked up at him, his small hands coming to cup around Hawks. "It's not what you think," he said weakly. "I-I just-"
"It's okay," Hawks said, dropping his hands off to his waist. "You don't trust me. I get it. I don't blame you."
"That's not-"
"It's okay," Hawks replied back, leaning in to press their forehead together. "I'll earn that."
With that, he got off the bed.
"One report about the Imperial Capital, coming right off."
And he left, leaving just a few feathers behind. 

-

Midoriya looked up at the shelf, why were all the people here so damn tall? How the hell was he going to get the books at the top? He tilted his head, this way and that, before he came closer. Standing on the tips of his toes, he could brush against the spine with his fingertips.
Okay, this wasn't going to-
"Which one?"
Giving a quiet gasp as he pressed himself closer to the bookshelf, Midoriya tensed considerably.
"Calm down, I'm grabbing you your book. Which one?"
"I-I, uh, I- Oh, uhm-"
The heat of Sakamata against him brought vivid memories (that weren't his) to the forefront of his mind. The feeling on his smooth skin, hands that dwarfed his hips, ghosted over his skin and his face flushed. Heat shot straight to his belly, and he shivered at the feeling of Sakamata's voice dropping next to his ear.
"I suppose we can do other activities as well," he murmured. 
"T-The red one," Midoriya finally bit out. "Please."
Sakamata pulled the book out and took a step back. Midoriya, still unable to control his features, stayed against the bookshelf like an insect. 
"Y-You can put it on the table over there."
"Do I disgust you?" Sakamata asked. "I suppose-"
"What? No!" Midoriya whipped around, surprised and astonished that he would say that when just his voice had Midoriya's stomach flip-flopping. "The opposite."
"You don't call me to your chambers anymore."
Midoriya blinked face, his features flushing again. "I uh... It's uhm..."
"...I see. I understand."
Why did people have to equate their worthfulness to if they have sex? Why was this the way to judge the value of someone's life. Midoriya couldn't find an answer no matter how hard he tried. 
But that was a lie. He knew why people thought like that. It was because the Empress Izuku was that kind of person. She assigned that kind of value. No matter how much Midoriya hated it, to these people, that was literally last month.
"It's not like that, I promise you," Midoriya said, reaching over to grab Sakamata's hand. "I... I think you are beautiful. And I... I didn't know how to explain that to you."
"You are a terrible liar."
Which was accurate. Since Midoriya didn't want to spend the night with anyone while his fevers ran rampant. However, this was different.
"I..." What could he say? How did he even begin with excusing this?
Actually, the answer was much more simpler than he thought.
"I'm sorry."
There was a long stretch of silence, it started to go stale, so Midoriya tried to turn away. It was as awkward as it was uncomfortable, so he wanted to leave. Simple.
Except nothing was simple since he got into his body.
A massive hand came to grab his wrist.
"Don't leave," Sakamata said, "If you mean that, then don't leave."
Midoriya stared back, eyes wide as Sakamata kneeled down in front of him. Kneeling like that, he was still taller than Midoriya, and he gently tugged the younger man closer.
"And if you mean that, then keep me by your side."
"I..."
Midoriya stared, because he didn't want this. He didn't want someone who would hold him like he was a delicate flower, who would hold him because he was the only remains of a dying royalty in a suffocating empire. He didn't want it.
"I will believe you," Sakamata said, slowly standing up. "I did not mean to put you on the spot like this. For that, I hope you'll forgive me. However, I want you to know this for certain." He lifted Midoriya's small, small hand up to his snout, rubbing it gently, "I will earn your trust."
And with that, Sakamata left in a flurry of expensive robes adorned with gems and regal embrodiery. Leaving Midoriya, back ot the bookshelf, hand hanging midair, wondering how he was going to explain this to All Might.

-

"Sakamata is strong," Yagi said, taking it in stride easily, "I don't have any complaints."
"He's..." Midoriya made a vague motion to their bed, "He wants to be here."
"Yes, we've shared before," Yagi said, an amused smile on his face when he saw Midoriya's face burst into color. "He'll be gentle with you."
"T-that's not the problem right now."
The blond tilted his head curiously, "Then what is?"
"I... You're not bothered?"
Blue eyes dropped to the space between them.
"I... I'm alright. If it would bring you safety and comfort, I don't mind-"
"That's not what I asked."
The blond shook his head. Collecting Midoriya's face into his hands, he pressed a kiss to his lips. The Empire's Flower opened his mouth immediately, lettng the older man take his time to rub their tongues together. He gave a quiet gasp as Yagi pulled away. Taking in flushed features, a wide grin stretched across Yagi's face.
"As long as I'm with you, I can imagine no greater future."
As though to seal the vow, he kissed him once more. 
"Still..."
"I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe. Sakamata is a good candidate for both, but you have to make that decision on your own. If Sakamata is someone you don't want by your side, then don't have him. If you desire him, then keep him."
"Isn't that selfish?"
Yagi gave a laugh, a crystalized sound. He tilted his head, blue eyes filled to the brim with adoration.
"You deserve everything good in the world."
And instead of a primal kind of heat, Midoriya felt as though his heart would beat right out of his chest.

### Housamo - Pansy

Alone, Shennong thought, he was okay being alone. He thought and believed it, until that hand slid into his, and with a wide grin on her face, tugged him along to view the starry skies from the flower field. He should have been okay, being alone.
Wrapping an arm around her, his human, he rubbed his face alongside her. She giggled, a bright sound that he could encase in his heart so he would be reminded of a time when he wasn't alone.
