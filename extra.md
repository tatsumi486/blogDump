Hawks want it to be written somewhere and down for the record, okay? He was the original TodoDeku shipper.

# Kind Nightmare

Sometimes, Midoriya wished that they wouldn't be in his home when he comes home. And then he thought about it, and what Grandma Mirae from two doors over would say to the group of people that could be caught hanging in front of his door, and remended his initial thoughts.
Sometimes, Midoriya wished that no one would bother him. Or at least, they would let him know, at least four days in advance, that they were going to show up in his life for any period of time. 
"Oh! Good timing! Welcome home, Midoriya!"
But Midoriya was an idiot. A stupid, incurable idiot.
The  sound of someone welcoming him home had his eyes burning. His heart twisted, flipping inside out and upside down. He stood there, unmoving as the door hit him, and he stared.
Hawks, a confused smile on his face and his wings folded behind him, came out of the kitchen and to the entrance way. 
"C'mon," he said, feathers coming to open the door. A feather came to Midoiya's hand, and pushed it towards Hawks. The older man took his hand and tugged him closer. He pressed a kiss to the top of his head, "Do you have a lot of homework?" he asked, "That TV special on the Bronze Age Heroes is going to start soon."
Midoriya stared at Hawks for another moment.
"...Midoriya?" the blond asked, "You tired? If you want, I can record it, and we can watch it later."
"I... I don't get it." Midoriya said at last.
The blond stared at him for a moment longer before his shoulders relaxed and he smiled back. "There is a TV special program that's going to talk about the bronze-age heroes," he explained, "I wanted to know if you wanted to watch it together now when it was live, or if you wanted me to record it so we can watch it later."
Midoriya's eyebrows furrowed, and he didn't get it, and he didn't understand. He shook his head, and frustration laced his voice, "But why?"
"Because I like you?" Hawks replied, arching an eyebrow back. "Because I want to spend time with you? Because I think it'd make you happy? Is this a trick question?"
Midoriya stared at him before he gaze dropped to the ground. His free hand came up to cover his mouth, as though he was about to become physically ill, and Hawks' expression turned a little more serious.
"It's okay," he said, "You don't owe me anything, Midoriya. You can say no."
Midoriya's shoulders hunched over, and his body trembled, as though he could not withstand the weight of Hawks words.
"N-no, I'll do it," he said.
"...Midoriya," Hawks said quietly, "Talk to me. What are you thinking about?"
"It's-it's fine," the young student said, "I can do it. I'll do it."
The blond stared for a moment, before he sighed.
"...Can I kiss you?"
Midoriya replied by closing his eyes and tilting his head up. When Hawks' hands came up to cup his face, he felt the young man tense, and just as fast, he forced himself to relax. 
A tight feeling twisted his heart into a knot. Hawks stared for a moment longer before he pressed a kiss to Midoriya's forehead.
"I did things out of order," he said, "Welcome home, Midoriya." He pressed another kiss to his brow before he took a step back. "How was your day?"
"I-" Midoriya stared at him, and then his eyes started to water. "Please don't," he said.
"Don't what?"
"I-I'm scared," he said. "So please, stop."
Hawks frowned, and Midoriya's hands came to his chest, and pushed the older man away.
"I can't handle this. Please don't treat me so well." He shook his head, his eyes glued to the ground, "Please. Can't... Can't we just fuck and be done?"
"No," Hawks replied, shaking his head. "I wanna treat you how you deserve to be treated-"
"But-but I might-" and Midoriya choked on the words but finally managed to spit them out, "I might expect things."
Oh. Is that the problem?
"Good," he said, "Midoriya. Expect things from me. Tell me about them. I know I was lazy and clumsy before but I know what I want now." His wings moved around to cocoon the two of them, and even though Hawks didn't move any closer, it felt like they were much slower together, "I want you. All of you. Safe, happy, with me, all of that. normall, I'd go at my fastest, but I want to enjoy this."
He stepped closer this time, leaning down to rub the tip of his nose against Midoriya's.
And in the privacy set by his wings, Hawks confessed a love he wanted to watch time age.

"Don't leave," Midoriya said. 
Shigaraki froze at the door. His hand on the doorknob. Slowly, he turned over his shoulder and stared, jaw slackening and his eyes wide.
"What did you say?"
Midoriya covered his face with his hands.

"You know," Yamada frowned, "All that talk about harmonizing, I always thought it would be like," he paused as though looking for the right word and finally decided on, "hard, you know?"
Aizawa frowned back, but didn't say anything. It was the closest thing to agreement they would get from him.
"Things get lost over time," Shirakumo replied, "As Conductors got rarer and rarer, it might have gotten harder and harder to harmonize. Just from," he made a vague gesture with his hand, "supply and demand and that."

But then Shirakumo took the knife straight through the heart. Aizawa watched, and felt like he was losing him again, but Shirakumo took a step back and then turned to his friend.
"I'm not dead."
"Maybe your heart is on the other side?" Yamada tried. His hand came up to the man, "Are... are you sure you're okay?"
Shirakumo pulled the blade out of his chest, and no blood spilled out.
Harmonizing, they thought, was a terryfying thing. It was a split second thought. 

Meanwhile:

Midoriya was walking down the stairs, arms full of the materials for the next class. When suddenly, it felt as though he had been kicked in the chest by a horse, and promptly lost all feeling in his legs and body. The pain, a sudden shock as though a shooting star had incinerated a path across his body, ricocheted through his body and he fell with a loud yelp. Right when his foot should have landed on the next step going down, his knee buckled out from underneath him. His back landed painfully on the staircase, but it was dull compared to the sensation of his chest splintering open. 
"Shit!" Sero's voice sounded as his teammate came running down, "Are you okay?!"
But all Midoriya could think about was Shirakumo.
"Y-Yeah," he lied, breathless and on the verge of crying. 

His arms tightened tightly around the box of supplies, but a few pieces of papers had flown out. 
"You're so clumsy!" Sero laughed, good-natured as he came right next to him. His eyes met his, and he arched an eyebrow. "You good?"
"Y-Yeah," Midoriya gasped, feeling as though his chest would concave in. For a moment, it almost felt like his head would explode as well, but the pain that wasn't his started to fade and his own aches came in full force. "S-Sorry about that," he said. He sat up, and winced when he felt his toes and fingertips tingle.
"You wanna head to the infirmary?"
"No, I'm okay," Midoriya said, eyes looking at the scattered papers. And then he could go home and check on Shirakumo himself.  Just the thought of Shirakumo, doing something that caused that kind of sharp pain in his chest, had his heart racing again. Where was he? What was he doing? Would he return to Midoriya?
His heart panged painfully at the thought.

When Midoriya's eyes laid on Shirakumo's face, he shoved everyone away and ran right to the man. Shirakumo, eyes bright, opened his arms up, expecting a hug when the young man's hands came right to his shirt, bunched the fabric and ripped it. Next to them, Aizawa's eyebrows climbed up, and Yamada covered his mouth. 
"Uh?" The confused noise that escaped his throat was drowned out when he gazed at Midoriya's expression. "Mido-"
The young man placed his hand flat over his chest, running it over smooth and unblemished skin right where his heart was. His eyes ran with tears, streaming down his face as he stepped closer. He placed his forehead at the top of Shirakumo's stomach, where he reached, and his body racked with tremors. 
"...I'm here," he said, arms wrapping around Midoriya. "I'm here."
"I-I felt..."
"Yeah, it was touch and go for a moment, but I'm here."
