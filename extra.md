### Dark Continent 

There was a bracelet on this human.
"Is it a fashion statement or something?" Twice asked, rolling over his stomach. He poked it, eyes flitting up to Midoriya's face when the man flinched backwards. "It looks too tight to look comfortable."
"It's a symbol," Midoriya replied back, his voice quiet. "It's not supposed to be comfortable."

-

"So, what? You're like, a criminal on the run?"
Criminal?
Midoriya stared because a lifetime told him that criminals were bad, awful people. He blinked, and managed a smile.
"Yes," he said. Because at least criminals had a choice. The law applied to them. Didn't that mean that they were, at least, human?
He gave a grin.
"You don't..." Spinner hesitated, "Look like a criminal. Like, criminals should look more like-"
"-Do not say my name," Dabi cut in.
"-like a criminal," he decided on. 
Midoriya's smile was as gentle as the first rays of sunshine after a rain storm.
"I'm... not like the other criminals?"
Spinner and Dabi leveled him a tired look.

-

"Be careful," Dabi said, "it gets cold during the winter." He dropped a few pelts on his table. Stretching his neck he turned back to Midoriya, "And knowing you, you're going to get sick anyways, aren't you?"
"I'm pretty tough," he said, wrapping his arms around Dabi's chest and resting his cheek against the man's back, "and it's not cold."
Holding onto Dabi like that, he couldn't see his expression. But Dabi's fingers rested on his, as gentle as snowfall.
"Yeah?" the older man asked. "Maybe I should stay then."
"Could you?"
Midoriya's voice was light, bright, and the older man laughed.
"Nah, I don't wanna deal with your whiny ass."
"I'm not that bad!" the young man exclaimed, affronted.
Dabi chuckled. He tugged Midoriya's hands off his chest so he could turn around. Leaning down, he pecked his forehead.
"Yeah," he said, "You are." His arms wrapped around his waist and pulled him closer. Pressing a kiss to his nose, then his cheek, he placed his forehead on his shoulder and inhaled deeply. "You're awful."
"Your actions don't match your words," Midoriya complained, but his hands came to his back, holding him firmly. "If I'm so awful, why are you here?"
Dabi hummed, "You still haven't figured it out?"
Midoriya's arms came down his side, and he pushed the older man back a little more. Looking mildly annoyed at the fact that he was getting pushed away, he still leaned back. 
Small hands came up to his face, cupping his cheeks, and Dabi nuzzled his face against his palms. Kissing the base of his hands, he slowly opened his eyes and made eye contact with Midoriya. 
He leaned in to press a soft kiss to his lips, he hummed in delight when Dabi immediately opened his mouth and invited him in. A quiet kiss, languiid in nature still had his toes curling in a delightful way. 
"Something like this?" he asked, panting just a little bit when they pulled away.
"Hm," Dabi looked thoughtful. "I might need another sample to be certain."
"You're ridiculous," Midoriya laughed, leaning in to give him just that.

-

"When... When we give our [True Names], it binds our soul to them," Eraserhead explained. 
"...Isn't that important?" Midoriya asked, placing his hand over his heart.
"Yes, but that's also how we know you're not one of us."
"Huh?"
"Midoriya Izuku," Eraserhead, "That's not your name, is it?"
And Midoriya supposed that, so long as his slave marked his body, he wouldn't be anything more than [Deku]. He smiled back at Eraserhead.
"If I told you that I haven't lied to you, would you believe me?"
Eraserhead grabbed his chin and pressed his lips against his. His grip was bruising, and his tongue forced itself into his mouth. He sucked harshly, and his hand came to the back of Midoriya's head, tiling it so that he could get better access. One of his knees came up to the side of Midoriya, and Midoriya's neck was starting to hurt from the angle he was put in. His fingers came up to hold onto Eraserhead's shirt.
The older man pulled back. Aside from the pink dusting his cheeks, he looked otherwise undistrubed. 
"I wanted to make one with you," he said, "A soul bond."
He got off the young man and sat down next to him.
"But it doesn't work if it's one-sided."
Midoriya wished his words and wishes meant something. He leaned his head against Eraserhead's shoulder. 
"I'm sorry," Midoriya whispered.

There was a simple way to test it. There was such a simple way to do it, but it required courage. Izuku didn't have that.
He placed his hand over his heart and dug his fingers into the skin.If courage could be derived from pain, he would have copious amounts of it.
Shaking his head, Izuku sighed, sick of disappointing himself. this was ridiculous. This shouldn't bother him so much. He was fine. He could take on groups of eight monsters altogether, but he was suddenly mute when it came to asking for some assitance.
No, that wasn't what bothered him.
What bothered him, what scared him, wasn't that. It was the expectations that would come afterwards. The undeniable certainty that indeed, Izuku could not do this by himself.
He placed his hand on the commlink, "Who can fight?"
Please.
"Stain reporting in."
"Miruko reporting in."
"Endeavor reporting in."
"Hai, hai, Toga-chan here!"
"Hawks, reporting for duty!"
"Spinner, reporting in!"
The flood of calls, of replies, made his heart swell. 
"Izuku," Dabi's voice was certain, "Your orders."
In his mind's eye, he could see where everyone was. Their fatigued features, their frustration and their injures. Undoubtedly, they were as tired as he was, probably even more so. Izuku felt his heart palpate. His hands trembled.
If this was a one-time thing. If this was just a dream.
Then he prayed that they will all wake up the following morning.
"Miruko, Stain, get to the emergency staircase. Endeavor, Spinner, get to the main stairwell. Hawks, get the main gates. Toga, Dabi, get to the parking lot."
He took a deep breath.
"About 50 monsters left. And additional 14 mutants left. Temples are weak point. Resitant to fire. They're not fast, but they're durable. None of them leave alive."
"Yes, sir!"
And it almost sounded like they were going to listen to him. He looked up the stairs. At the top floor, he would have to chase them all down. With a deep breath, he made a fist and chanelled the Quirk that Wasn't For Him. Hitting the ground, splintering it, ruining the hard work of someone else, he destroyed the flooring of the floor he was in and jumped backwards. As expected, the collateral damage had the building shaking and the monsters fled. Choked-out screams echoed from the stairwell. 
He threw a few pens at the monsters as they ran out. His knee-jerk reaction was to run after and hunt down each and every single one of them, but with his side bleeding out and one of his arm broken, this was better. He needed to trust. And if his trust wasn't for naught, then he would know and someone would die and something worse would be waiting for them all after this battle. 
Some monsters past him completely fine, but most were innjured. It was the only other thing that he could do for them. This was his limit. Instead of pain, he felt shame. Instead of shame, he should be focused. It was because he didn't focus that he was in this mess to begin with. 
Within 15 minutes, they had finished making their way through the building. At the very least, Izuku was glad that he didn't need to completely trash the building. Pushing open one of the windows on the first floor, Izuku crawled out. He looked around, where they were dragging bodies out and then leaned against the wall. His hand came to his side and he took several deep breaths. 
He closed his eyes, focused on his hearing, and almost cried. They were all alive. 
"Emergency stairwell cleared," Miruko called in.
"Main stairwell cleared," Spinner reported.
"Izuku-chan!" his commlink came to life, "all 14 mutants are dead and burning!" Toga's cheerful voice broke thorugh. 
"Counting 47 bodies total," Hawks relayed.
"Four more," Endeavor's voice came onto the commlink,
"We have two more too," Miruko added.
53 total.
Izuku limped out into the hallway. He could feel his conciousness starting to fade a little. Relief was bad for him, wasn't it? He leaned against the doorframe, his hand coming to his side. He couldn't tell if it was still bleeding or-
"Danna-sama?!"
Standing in front of him in an instant was Endeavor and Spinner. He waved them off and pushed off the wall. Be strong. Stand tall. As he thought this to himself, he couldn't help the smile on his face when he saw their ragged state. It must have been a tough battle. He sent a tough battle to them. The thought sank deeply in his heart.
"Good work," he said.
"... You too," Endeavor replied back.
"T-Thank you very much," Spinner bowed back politely, his eyes darting from Izuku to his side and then his exposed, purple arm, and then back. "Are you... okay?"
He nodded back, "We're alive," he said. And then, the laughter came bubbling out of his lips. "We're alive."
"Yes," Endeavor nodded his head. "We are."
It almost felt like a step forward. Which was foolish, because Izuku's fight was only starting now. 
He straightnened out, taking a moment to orient himself, before he made his way out. His steps turned certain, and his features soured as he exited the building. 
Trust was a strange thing, because suddenly, he had to remember to frown when he saw the others. 

-

It spelled out a bad time for him if his bat was already broken. 

-

There had to be something. He can't fuck with this. If this backfires, they'll lose their best baiting trap here. Not for the first time, he wished that the internet wasn't down. If only he could just fucking Google it.
["Does an omega's scent change when they're pregnant?"]
He wanted to say no. He so desperately wanted to say no. He didn't want anything else about his life to be defined by being an omega. He flipped through the book, and no dice. Just the same things, over and over again.
[Omegas release phermones that can cause a rise in primal urges...]
[Omegas have no control over their state and need proper care and management...]
He covered his face. Waited for his boiling rage to shimmer down. Useless. Everything here was useless. At this point, he would just have to test it.
For a fact, he knew that once an omega was bonded, their alpha was pretty much the only person that could smell them. It wasn't that they stopped smelling, but it was pretty muted, and the scent of their union was the main smell that people smelled. From what he understood, after bonding, if the alpha died, the omega would probably die if they didn't have another alpha bond them. But obviously, in a world where alphas where expected to have several omegas, alphas were fine even if they killed the omegas that they were bonded with.
But how much of that was reality and how much of that was just an agenda?
Izuku rubbed his face harder. This whole thing was such fucking bullshit.

[Izuku's Left Eye]

"...Izuku," Chisaki said, "Look at me." He made a motion at Kurono, and the man lifted up his index finger. "While looking at me, can you tell me how many fingers Hari has up?"
A slow smile, one filled with bitter regrets, stretched Izuku's lips. It told Chisaki enough. The older man covered his face and took a deep breath, while Kurono's arms dropped to his side. 
"Forget about it," Izuku said.
"It's your eye!" he snapped back. "Half your eyesight! I can't-I can't heal that! do you understand-"
Izuku stood up, deciding that this conversation was over. 
"This one works," he said, pointing at his working eye. "And so does this one," he continued, pointing at Chisaki.
Chisaki's jaw tightened considerably. "You're awful. A devil with the face of an angel."

-

"Hm? Izuku-san? Uh, Izuku-chan?" Kaminari stammered out, but Izuku didn't give him a second glance. The taller man made a quick 180 so that they were walking in the same direction. "Are you going through here?" he asked, "Lemme get the door for you-"
Nearly tripping over his own foot, he rushed to the door. Pushing it open, he turned back to Izuku with a sheepish smile.
He threw a wary glance at the man, eyed his uncertain smile, and gave a curt nod. Kaminari's smile was so bright that Izuku's steps faltered.

"I thought you couldn't get re-assessed."
"They made an exception," Midoriya explained it quietly and patiently, "because we need the Best."
"But why does it have to be you?"
And Midoriya beamed back.
"Because I wanted to protect the place where I met you."
Natsuo remembered those times with shame. After all, it was from a time where he didn't know better and didn't realize that happiness was something he could have too. His face crumpled with the guilt and the disgust because Midoriya smiled like he remembered something lovely when in reality, he only remembered Natsuo.

Japan had over 100 milion people, what was the liklihood that 10 S-Rankers selected to go on the raid would include Midoriya?
It made his heart ache.

-

"Natsuo," Touya opened his mouth to speak once Midoriya was gone. "Do you think that you're the only one being left behind?"

-

"...We can't let them escape from the gate, right?" Midoriya asked. 
"Yeah, that's why we're here-"
And just as fast a barrier was set up. A chill came over them.
"Don't waste your mana," Best Jeanist chided. 
Midoriya shook his head, "If it'll bring security and safety, it's not a waste."
That barrier continued, untouched and outputting the same ridiculous amount of magic, until the clean-up of Okinawa finished up, about a month later. It covered social media, countdowns were made dedicated to it. 

-

"...I'm sorry, what?"
Natsuo stared at Touya in true betrayal. 
"Twice," Touya said, patting his shoulder, "This is my brother, Natsuo." Cold eyes pinned him down as he regarded him, "Nat-kun, this is Twice. We used to Raid together."
"Yo, yo, yo what's up?! Twice in the house! // I hate it here!" the man yelled out, going hot to cold and then back. The tanker leaned back, disgust on his face.
"Used to? You mean..."
Touya nodded. "Before I got into that gate," he confirmed.
"Whoa, Double the Todorokis!" he exclaimed out, "Not too bad! Is he strong or more like you, Todoroki? // Aw, he looks so weak! I'm not here to babysit!"
Touya replied by kicking him in the thigh.
"Ouch! // That felt good!"
Natsuo gave Touya this look. He shrugged back.
"He's trustworthy."
"Wow, is this your place?" Twice whistled as he walked in, "I sorta expected bigger from a Bocchan like you, Todoroki. // Are you poor now?"
Behind Twice's back, Touya flipped him off.
"He's coming with us to the gate today," he said.
Natsuo watched as Twice dropping onto the couch. He stretched out against it, and groaned loudly.
"Man prison food was awful! Your couch is so nice! This feels great!" he yelled out, seemingly as loud as he could, "//I wanna go back!"
"Is this... really going to be okay?" Natsuo whispered out, "Like, is it okay if he met Midoriya?"
Because the only person that treasured Midoriya as much as he did was Touya, or so he thought.
"Midoriya? Oh that new hotshot Supporter?" Twice called out. Stupid enhanced Hunter hearing. "Yeah, he's cute. A big young for me though," he said. "//I hate him! Supporters as just deadweight anyways."
Hands clenching into tight fists, Natsuo scowled. He took a step forward, when the door to their modest apartment opened.
"Hello?" Midoriya said, quiet as he peered inside. He saw Natsuo and Touya and visibly relaxed. "Guest?"
"Come on in," Touya said, wrenching the door open. "You live here, remember? Just enter."
A soft pink dusted his cheeks as he shuffled in. 
"How was your run?" Touya asked, totally ignoring the way Twice sat up in his seat. 
"I-It was good," Midoriya stammered out. He kneeled down to untie his shoes and after putting them neatly to one side, stood up. He peered around Touya to the blond on the couch. He looked from Touya to Natsuo, no doubt picking up how tense the younger Todoroki looked, and then looked back to the stranger.
"Remember how I talked about adding an attacker?" Touya asked, stepping to the side. "He's the only one I know. His name is Twice."
"Hey, is this your little friend?"
Natsuo jerked backwards. He didn't even hear Twice move, until he was next to Touya, peering down at the young support. Natsuo wasted no time putting himself between the two. 
"Oh, he's good," Twice said, "//He's bad!"
"Izuku," Touya's voice was soft, "He's not hostile. He's just like that."
And that's when Natsuo understood that there were four barriers up. The first being around the apartment. The second around their entranceway that they were huddled in. The third around the fourth of them.
And the last keeping Twice in a glowing box of translucent green.
"I didn't even see you cast!" Twice said, he rapped the wall in front of him, and flinched backwards when it shocked him. "Yikes! // That felt good!"
"If he's going to pick on Natsuo, he leaves."
Both Touya and Natsuo turned to stare at Midoriya, clearly not expecting this turn of events. In that moment, it wasn't hard to see the shadow of the man Midoriya would turn into, standing at the top of the world as the Greatest. The thrum of power couldn't be felt, but it was so dense that they could reach up and hold it. The young man didn't look away from Twice.
"Damn," the blond whistled, "He's cool. // He's rude!"
Midoriya kept his eyes on Twice as he asked, "When's the gate again?"
"An hour," Touya reported, "We can leave in 15 though."
"Let's go now," the youngest said, "and warm up."
Twice grinned back.

-

"Weren't you in jail?" Natsuo asked.
Twice spun his blades, getting the loose trails of blood off of them, and he looked up.
"Huhhh?" he tilted his head, "Yeah?"
"You're... good," Natsuo admitted, he didn't want to admit it, but this guy was good. If Ranks were determined by experience and skill, he would definately be top-tier.
"Ah, part of community service for Hunters is going through gates that you couldn't before."

-

"So, where do I put it?"
"Put what?"
Hawks gave a blinding grin as he waved the manilla folder in his hand.
"You're looking for people in the build, right? I'm here with my application," he said, a patient smile on his face as he eyed Midoriya. "Where should I put it?"
"But you're a tank. With your own guild."
"Yeah, but you're here."
Midoriya flushed, his cheeks turning pink. "Oh," he said, quiet as he fiddled with his hoodie's laces. "But uhm... I-I thought that you wouldn't want to, since you..." he trailed off. Looking back up at Hawks for just a second before his gaze dropped to the ground and curled in a little more on himself. "i thought that that mission was over."
"...It is," he said, "so I'm here." He grinned at him, charming and bright as he laid his heart on the line, "I want to be with you."
Midoriya Izuku turned this shade of cherry red that had Hawks licking his lips. 
"Even if you don't want to take on my application for a fulltime position, consider inviting me for some gates."
"I don't think we could match your salary..."
"That's fine. I have more than enough money," the blond said, waving his hand. "I just want to spend some time with you."

-

"Augh," Natsuo's nose crinkled with his disgust, "Hawks came by again? Doesn't he have anything better to do?"
Midoriya stared up at him, a bouquet of roses in his hands.
"What... do I do with these?"
"Throw them away," Natsuo seethed back.
The young man took a step back, "But they're pretty."
"I can buy you some too," he muttered, coming around to crouch down in front of Midoriya. He looked up at the young man, "do you like them?" he asked quietly.
"I've never recieved flowers before," he said quietly, quietly marveling at the flowers.
Natsuo, who could sense that the flowers already had several preservation spells on them, heaved a great sigh. He stood up.
"Natsuo?"
Without another word, the man grabbed his jacket and left.

-

"...I'm sorry, what?"
"My mana keeps him calm," Midoriya said, "So he'll be coming around with me until he can get situated."
Natsuo spluttered, and looked at the man behind Midoriya. Just a head smaller than him, but a good couple inches taller than Midoriya, an unfamiliar blond stood behind the young man.
Augh, Midoriya and his blonds.

-

"...My name is Aizawa Shota," he said, and then motioned to the man behind him, "This is Yamada Hizashi."
"Y-Yes, hello," Natsuo almost smacked himself. Why was he hesitating? He cleared his throat and pulled his shoulders back. He was the tank. He needed to keep focus.
"We're here to apply to join Midoriya's group."
"We're not taking any applications," Natsuo snapped back.
Aizawa scowled, "I'm not asking you."
"Hey, Shota, we're not here to fight," Yamada whispered out to him. "Chill out, will you?"
The older man gave a frustrated sigh, but dipped his head forward.
"I'm sorry about my friend," Yamada said, "The truth is, we're here because we heard that you guys found Shirakumo."
"...Shirakumo?" Natsuo repeated. He thought back to the quiet blond that tried to fold himself behind Midoriya. "Huh?"
"...Maybe we should start there then."
"We're here to


Natsuo, thinking that they would take Shirakumo off their hands, accepted them with open arms. Never once did he think the three of them would make a home at the guild office instead.

-

"Throw these away," Touya said, his voice a quiet murmur, as he passed a thick packet towards the other man, "and don't let Izuku see them."
Shirakumo frowned as he took the packet of letters from him, "What are they?" he asked.
"Requests to find missing hunters."
The blond's brow furrowed and he looked up at Touya with a frown. the older man shrugged back.
"The liklihood of returning when Midoriya is a participating member of the Raid is 110%," he explained, "Needless to say, there are a lot of people who believe that their missing hunter is just lost in a gate, waiting to be saved."
Shirakumo and Touya, the only recorded people in history to get stuck in a gate, and return out alive through another gate. A hundred different investigations were undergoing around the world, just because of this, and only a few questions have been answered. Undoubtedly, as the people that had been found, and had choosen to take Midoriya's hand to come back, they had some part in these kinds of things.
"...Is that so," Shirakumo said quietly, taking it into his hands.
The weight of all their hopes and dreams to find people was less than three pounds.
"It's heavy," he said.

-

Jin's hands were tight on Midoriya's shoulders.
"Be careful," he stressed. "Just because they're handsome doesn't mean that you should just accept anyone, okay?"
"Hey, I brought back some ice cream," Hawks called out when he returned to their office, "Anyone want any?"
"Me!" Jin shouted, raising his hands excitedly. "I do!"
The look of disgust Natsuo shot him went unnoticed.

-

"...Hey, is our guild going to be okay?" Natsuo asked one day.
From behind a pile of paperwork, Aizawa bared his teeth.
"It better be."

Midoriya Izuku had ten seconds to mourn the loss of his parents before he had to attend a dealing. Something about a family of three, with the youngest trying to go to college and the mother being sick...
The entire scenrio made him sick to his stomach, but nothing did quite as well as the knowing smile from his anikis when they saw him.
