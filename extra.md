### returning a gift

"But you're not going to betray us, right Izuku?"
The question was simple. His next words would effectively decide how the rest of their night will go. Depending on what he says and does, it's likely that this whole thing will go belly up in the future. He knew what he had to say to difuse the situation.
He knew.
"Toga-chan," he said, and going against his best plans, spoke honestly. "What does it mean, to betray you?" he asked. His expression scrunched, as though he was in an insufferable amount of pain. "whatever it is, it's fine. I won't fight you."
The blond stared at him for a moment.
"Likewise, if you decide to betray me or kill me or whatever, I won't blame you."
"...Because you know me?"
He smiled back. He wasn't a stranger to lying to get what he wanted. And Midoriya knew what he wanted for a very long time. Lying wasn't the worst thing he has done, or will ever do. Lying to someone who looked at him so earnestly wasn't hard.
"Because I trust you."
That's why,when Toga understood that he lied to her in this moment, he hoped that she would be betrayed. She would feel betrayed and she would come for revenge. Toga wasn't someone that left grudges go so easily, you see. Midoriya knew.
Midoriya knew, and could not wait to die by her hand.

-

The thought intruded in his head again.
If he just laid here, didn't do anything, didn't fight it, just stopped everyhting, it would be over. He would die. No more tomorrow. No more fighting and no more killing. The heroes that he loved and idolized as a child wouldn't disappoint him anymore. The people that he loved and cared about wouldn't need to get injured for him anymore.

### gacha hell

((better make a spreadsheet where all the charactrs & rarity & stats because why not))

A hand grabbed his wrist, and without meaning to, Midoriya squeaked. Immediately, the man who pulled him stopped and he leaned in closer instead. 
"...Was my grip too strong?" Dabi said, and his concern would have been much more believable, if it wasn't for that damned smile curling on his face. He leaned in even closer, his lips brushing past his cheek with a, "So sorry."
Midoriya, who could feel his unapologtic words blow across his hot face, spluttered back.

"I uh... I thought about it. What you said."
Toga stared at Uraraka, the uncertain smile on her face and a broken two-by-four board in her hand. The blood splattered on her, coupled with the sight of her ripped sleeves and a whirlwind-weathered kind of hairstyle, she looked like a far-cry from the bubbly girl who looked so safely tucked away on base. 
"About... About how not everyone was born with parents who loved their kids and wanted to protect them, even if it meant that they died. About that. I thought about that after you said it."
She turned to Toga.
"And because my parents died to protect me, because they loved me, I think you're missing a piece to your logic." She gave her a wide grin, looking more beautiful than anything Toga had ever laid eyes on. She laughed a little, not at all hysteric even though there was a dead body between them. "We got each other now, right?"
Toga stared, wide-eyed and at a loss for words. It would have been easier if Uraraka had met her and gotten familiar and then left because she didn't like Toga like everyone else Toga's ever met and known. It would have been easier, and Toga wouldn't have cared that there was another person in the world that didn't like her.
But someone that knew her and wanted to protect her? Someone that knew her and would choose to stay?
Someone, who wanted to be a hero and had experienced joys and the brighter side of society that was made for 'right' people and not people like her who were fucked up in the head and deemed broken? She didn't get it. 
If heroes were really like her, if there were really heroes like her, why did she only meet one now? 
Uraraka's expression softened as she kneeled down next to her.
"It's okay," she said, placing her hand on Toga's back. "I'll be here now."
But Toga was Toga because she never had anything to lose. She knew, saw, killed, people who had lost everything. Toga didn't want to be someone like that. Looking at Uraraka, Toga didn't think she could ever be smile like that after losing everything worth loving.
She didn't think she would ever smile again, ever love again, if she lost her home.

Deku was sitting up when Hawks came in. Even htough he was already told that he was okay, seeing it for himself like this brought more comfort to himself.
"Yo, can I come in?"
The young man nodded his head. 
"How you feeling?" he asked. 
"How's everyone else?"
The blond paused momentarily, an exaperated huff escaping his lips.
"You were bleeding from your head, and unresponsive like hell," the older man said, "And sleeping for four hours. But oyu're going to ask about the others?"
Deku's eyebrows furrowed, clearly not see what was wrong with the situation.
"...They're fine. All six of us came back."
"...Six?"
The blond nodded, "Six. You, me, Best Jeanist-san, Gang Orca-san, Shoji-kun, and Jiro-chan."
"Seven," Deku argued back, eyebrows pinched. "There were seven of us."
The blond stared at him for a second longer before he ran for the window. 
"I'll check. Stay here," he said, throwing the window open and launching out of it. As soon as he left, Deku started to get up. His body ached, but he didn't let it stop him. 
-
A few moments later, there was a loud, frantic knocking on his door. 
"It's Sakamata, I'm coming in," he said as he opened the door. "Deku, Hawks just left to check. Jiro's with him..." he trailed off, eyes narrowing at the state of Deku. "...Shouldn't you still be resting"
In Sakamata's hand, the walkie came to life, cutting their conversation short.
"Jiro and Hawks, reporting in. We're at location," Jiro's voice carried throgh the walkie. "Nothing more than a few rodents so far."

Deku was staring at the wall again. Mina tilted her head to the side, looking to what he was staring at, the patch of white in the corner of room, and then back to him.
"Something interesting there?" she asked. Maybe he was being forced to keep himself awake or something, so she should just leave and let him rest.
"...I can't hear you," he called out. 
Clearly not expecting an answer like that, her head snapped over to him. She watched as green eyes narrowed at the patch on the wall.
"I... I'll call Chisaki-"
"Speak up," he called out, cutting her off. 


### sat 

Four steps past the school gates, Midoriya suddenly came to a stop. Whipping around suddenly, he stared at the blond behind him.
"You're coming too?"
And Midoriya, who never seemed to care or even notice who or what came with them, asked Yagi with so much incredulous shock that the blond flinched backwards. 
"I uh... Yes?"
Midoriya stared at him for a moment and then at himself. He hesitated, and then then started to head back to the school.
"...What?" 
The rest of the patrol group stood in shared shock. Do they just, keep moving? Like Midoriya did? Did they wait? Groups that went on their own usually left by themselves, whenever they felt like it, so the remains were poele that liked traveling with Midoriya (regardless if the young man wanted him or not). 
"Are... Are you kidding me?" Aizawa hissed out, "That's it? That's all we had to do to keep him here?"
"Uh, is patrol cancelled?" Hojo asked, "I... I really don't want to explain this to Chisaki-san. Should we just leave anyways?"
In their confusion and with limited information, they stood there and waited instead.
"I.. did I do something?" Yagi asked quietly, walking up to Aizawa with a wild look in his eyes.
"Shouldn't I be asking you that?" the older man hissed back.
Just when their confused silence was about to turn even more awkward, however, Midoriya returned. With a bat in hand, really reminesent of Before they learned who he was, he came back. He shot Yagi a glance.
"Stay in the back," he told him, and moved to the front. Without looking at the rest of them, he moved on. 
"Okay, what the hell was that all about?" Twice chided him as he came to the front. "Really thought we were going to kill him. // Better save him!"
As always, Midoriya ignored him. 

-

"Are you joining us from now on?" Midoriya asked.
"Ah... I was planning on it," Yagi said. The weight of the gun on his back wasn't familiar, but if it was something that he could do to help, then... 
"Alright," the young man nodded. "I'll keep that in mind."
The blond stared, because it wasn't special treatment. Midoriya just wasn't the kind of person that cared about that kind of thing. Yagi hesitated for a second, before he brought it up.
"If you don't mind sharing, I was curious," he said quietly, "Is there a reason why you asked me? I didn't think that you..." he trailed off wen he realized how offensive his words would sound, but Midoriya finished his sentence.
"...would care?" he said. 
Yagi winced, but nodded.
A wry smile curled on his lips, perfectly framing a picture of a man who had long-lost his ability to laugh. The sight of it made Yagi's chest twist uncomfortably. 
"It's fine. I know what kind of reputation I have here," he said, and then moving back into their conversation, shrugged. "To answer your question, I... I didn't think you would want to see your quirk used to hurt people."
Another silence reigned on them.
"I see," Yagi said, covering his mouth with a hand. He could feel his organ churn uncomfortably, as though he could feel his heart rot away into nothing, and looked back up to Midoriya. "It must be hard," he said quietly, "to look after everyone."
"There's more than enough troubles to go around," Midoriya replied back, "No need to add more where I don't have to."
Yagi's hand trembled. Indeed, some time ago, he put people like Midoriya down for needless violence. Even now, he felt uncomfortable with the amount of gore that Midoriya was caked in, every time he returned. 
However, even though he meant well, and he was doing the man a kindness, Yagi couldn't help the incredulous feeling inside of him. Him? He needed to be looked after? The thought felt putrid. he was well-bodied. He didn't need to be looked after. Why would he need that? He was strong and powerful, even without a quirk. He-
The look in Midoriya's eyes, as he washed the blood off his hands in a bucket of bleach, stopped his words from escaping from his mouth. 


### Fgo? Housamo? au - > 

[ 
    For as long as Midoriya could remember, he's been sucked into a world just like the one he lived in, except everything was broken and rotting. Which was fine, because it was just a dream. As long as he woke up, it was fine.

    But in Midoriya's dream, even if the world came crashing down, he wasn't alone. When he was awake, he couldn't say the same thing.

]

All the windows in the corridor, in that instant, shattered. Midoriya's back hit the wall of the hallway as several other students screamed and shouted in their surprise. In the glass shards, he could see the sinister smile stretch acrpss its face-
"Midoriya?! Again?"
And trembling from a nightmare he couldn't wake up from, Midoriya could ask the same damn thing.
